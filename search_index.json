"],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction and Overview", " 1 Introduction and Overview The mlr3 (Lang et al. 2019) package and ecosystem provide a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis, and other machine learning tasks for the R language (R Core Team 2019). We do not implement any learners ourselves, but provide a unified interface to many existing learners in R. This unified interface provides functionality to extend and combine existing learners, intelligently select and tune the most appropriate technique for a task, and perform large-scale comparisons that enable meta-learning. Examples of this advanced functionality include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble construction. Parallelization of many operations is natively supported. Target Audience mlr3 provides a domain-specific language for machine learning in R. We target both practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms and researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment. The package is a complete rewrite of an earlier version of mlr that leverages many years of experience to provide a state-of-the-art system that is easy to use and extend. It is intended for users who have basic knowledge of machine learning and R and who are interested in complex projects that use advanced functionality as well as one-liners to quickly prototype specific tasks. Why a Rewrite? mlr (Bischl et al. 2016) was first released to CRAN in 2013, with the core design and architecture dating back much further. Over time, the addition of many features has led to a considerably more complex design that made it harder to build, maintain, and extend than we had hoped for. With hindsight, we saw that some of the design and architecture choices in mlr made it difficult to support new features, in particular with respect to pipelines. Furthermore, the R ecosystem as well as helpful packages such as data.table have undergone major changes in the meantime. It would have been nearly impossible to integrate all of these changes into the original design of mlr. Instead, we decided to start working on a reimplementation in 2018, which resulted in the first release of mlr3 on CRAN in July 2019. The new design and the integration of further and newly developed R packages (R6, future, data.table) makes mlr3 much easier to use, maintain, and more efficient compared to mlr. Design Principles We follow these general design principles in the mlr3 package and ecosystem. Backend over frontend. Most packages of the mlr3 ecosystem focus on processing and transforming data, applying machine learning algorithms, and computing results. We do not provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs); visualizations of data and results are provided in extra packages. Embrace R6 for a clean, object-oriented design, object state-changes, and reference semantics. Embrace data.table for fast and convenient data frame computations. Unify container and result classes as much as possible and provide result data in data.tables. This considerably simplifies the API and allows easy selection and “split-apply-combine” (aggregation) operations. We combine data.table and R6 to place references to non-atomic and compound objects in tables and make heavy use of list columns. Defensive programming and type safety. All user input is checked with checkmate (Lang 2017). Return types are documented, and mechanisms popular in base R which “simplify” the result unpredictably (e.g., sapply() or the drop argument in [.data.frame) are avoided. Be light on dependencies. One of the main maintenance burdens for mlr was to keep up with changing learner interfaces and behavior of the many packages it depended on. We require far fewer packages in mlr3 to make installation and maintenance easier. Package Ecosystem mlr3 requires the following packages: backports: Ensures backward compatibility with older R releases. Developed by members of the mlr3 team. checkmate: Fast argument checks. Developed by members of the mlr3 team. mlr3misc: Miscellaneous functions used in multiple mlr3 extension packages. Developed by the mlr3 team. mlr3measures: Performance measures for classification and regression. Developed by members of the mlr3 team. paradox: Descriptions of parameters and parameter sets. Developed by the mlr3 team. R6: Reference class objects. data.table: Extension of R’s data.frame. digest: Hash digests. uuid: Unique string identifiers. lgr: Logging facility. mlbench: A collection of machine learning data sets. None of these packages adds any extra recursive dependencies to mlr3. Additionally, the following packages are suggested for extra functionality: For parallelization, mlr3 utilizes the future and future.apply packages. To enable progress bars, use progressr. To capture output, warnings, and exceptions, evaluate and callr can be used. While mlr3 provides the base functionality and some of the most fundamental building blocks for machine learning, the following packages extend mlr3 with capabilities for preprocessing, pipelining, visualizations, additional learners or additional task types: A complete list with links to the respective repositories can be found on the wiki page on extension packages. References "],["basics.html", "2 Basics", " 2 Basics This chapter will teach you the essential building blocks of mlr3, as well as its R6 classes and operations used for machine learning. A typical machine learning workflow looks like this: The data, which mlr3 encapsulates in tasks, is split into non-overlapping training and test sets. Since we are interested in models that extrapolate to new data rather than just memorizing the training data, the separate test data allows to objectively evaluate models with respect to generalization. The training data is given to a machine learning algorithm, which we call a learner in mlr3. The learner uses the training data to build a model of the relationship of the input features to the output target values. This model is then used to produce predictions on the test data, which are compared to the ground truth values to assess the quality of the model. mlr3 offers a number of different measures to quantify how well a model performs based on the difference between predicted and actual values. Usually this measure is a numeric score. The process of splitting up data into training and test sets, building a model, and evaluating it may be repeated several times, resampling different training and test sets from the original data each time. Multiple resampling iterations allow us to get a better, more generalizable performance estimate for a particular type of model as it is tested under different conditions and less likely to get lucky or unlucky because of a particular way the data was resampled. In many cases, this simple workflow is not sufficient to deal with real-world data, which may require normalization, imputation of missing values, or feature selection. We will cover more complex workflows that allow to do this and even more later in the book. This chapter covers the following subtopics: Tasks Tasks encapsulate the data with meta-information, such as the name of the prediction target column. We cover how to: access predefined tasks, specify a task type, create a task, work with a task’s API, assign roles to rows and columns of a task, implement task mutators, and retrieve the data that is stored in a task. Learners Learners encapsulate machine learning algorithms to train models and make predictions for a task. They are provided by R and other packages. We cover how to: access the set of classification and regression learners that come with mlr3 and retrieve a specific learner, access the set of hyperparameter values of a learner and modify them. How to modify and extend learners is covered in a supplemental advanced technical section. Train and predict The section on the train and predict methods illustrates how to use tasks and learners to train a model and make predictions on a new data set. In particular, we cover how to: properly set up tasks and learners, set up train and test splits for a task, train the learner on the training set to produce a model, generate predictions on the test set, and assess the performance of the model by comparing predicted and actual values. Resampling A resampling is a method to create training and test splits. We cover how to access and select resampling strategies, instantiate the split into training and test sets by applying the resampling, and execute the resampling to obtain results. Additional information on resampling can be found in the section about nested resampling and in the chapter on model optimization. Benchmarking Benchmarking is used to compare the performance of different models, for example models trained with different learners, on different tasks, or with different resampling methods. We cover how to create a benchmarking design, execute a design and aggregate results, and convert benchmarking objects to resample objects. Binary classification Binary classification is a special case of classification where the target variable to predict has only two possible values. In this case, additional considerations apply; in particular: ROC curves and the threshold where to predict one class versus the other, and threshold tuning (WIP). Before we get into the details of how to use mlr3 for machine learning, we give a brief introduction to R6 as it is a relatively new part of R. mlr3 heavily relies on R6 and all basic building blocks it provides are R6 classes: tasks, learners, measures, and resamplings. "],["r6.html", "2.1 Quick R6 Intro for Beginners", " 2.1 Quick R6 Intro for Beginners R6 is one of R’s more recent dialects for object-oriented programming (OO). It addresses shortcomings of earlier OO implementations in R, such as S3, which we used in mlr. If you have done any object-oriented programming before, R6 should feel familiar. We focus on the parts of R6 that you need to know to use mlr3 here. Objects are created by calling the constructor of an R6Class() object, specifically the $new() method. For example, foo = Foo$new(bar = 1) creates a new object of class Foo, setting the bar argument of the constructor to 1. Classes have mutable state, which is encapsulated in their fields, which can be accessed through the dollar operator. We can access the bar value in the Foo class through foo$bar and set its value by assigning the field, e.g. foo$bar = 2. In addition to fields, objects expose methods that may allow to inspect the object’s state, retrieve information, or perform an action that may change the internal state of the object. For example, the $train method of a learner changes the internal state of the learner by building and storing a trained model, which can then be used to make predictions given data. Objects can have public and private fields and methods. In mlr3, you can only access the public variables and methods. Private fields and methods are only relevant to change or extend mlr3. R6 variables are references to objects rather than the actual objects, which are stored in an environment. For example, foo2 = foo does not create a copy of foo in foo2, but another reference to the same actual object. Setting foo$bar = 3 will also change foo2$bar to 3 and vice versa. To copy an object, use the $clone() method and the deep = TRUE argument for nested objects, for example, foo2 = foo$clone(deep = TRUE). For further information see wiki for short descriptions and links to the respective repositories. For more details on R6, have a look at the R6 vignettes. "],["tasks.html", "2.2 Tasks", " 2.2 Tasks Tasks are objects that contain the data and additional meta-data for a machine learning problem. The meta-data is, for example, the name of the target variable (the prediction) for supervised machine learning problems, or the type of the dataset (e.g. a spatial or survival). This information is used for specific operations that can be performed on a task. 2.2.1 Task Types To create a task from a data.frame() or data.table() object, the task type needs to be specified: Classification Task: The target is a label (stored as character()orfactor()) with only few distinct values. → mlr3::TaskClassif Regression Task: The target is a numeric quantity (stored as integer() or double()). → mlr3::TaskRegr Survival Task: The target is the (right-censored) time to an event. → mlr3proba::TaskSurv in add-on package mlr3proba Ordinal Regression Task: The target is ordinal. → TaskOrdinal in add-on package mlr3ordinal Cluster Task: An unsupervised task type; there is no target and the aim is to identify similar groups within the feature space. → Not yet implemented Spatial Task: Observations in the task have spatio-temporal information (e.g. coordinates). → Not yet implemented, but started in add-on package mlr3spatiotemporal 2.2.2 Task Creation As an example, we will create a regression task using the mtcars data set from the package datasets and predict the target \"mpg\" (miles per gallon). We only consider the first two features in the dataset for brevity. First, we load and prepare the data. data(&quot;mtcars&quot;, package = &quot;datasets&quot;) data = mtcars[, 1:3] str(data) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 32 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ mpg : num 21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ... ## $ cyl : num 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ... ## $ disp: num 160 160 108 258 360 ... Next, we create the task using the constructor for a regression task object (TaskRegr$new) and give the following information: id: An arbitrary identifier for the task, used in plots and summaries. backend: This parameter allows fine-grained control over how data is accessed. Here, we simply provide the dataset which is automatically converted to a DataBackendDataTable. Alternatively, we could also construct a DataBackend manually. target: The name of the target column for the regression problem. library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) task_mtcars = TaskRegr$new(id = &quot;cars&quot;, backend = data, target = &quot;mpg&quot;) print(task_mtcars) ## &lt;TaskRegr:cars&gt; (32 x 3) ## * Target: mpg ## * Properties: - ## * Features (2): ## - dbl (2): cyl, disp The print() method gives a short summary of the task: It has 32 observations and 3 columns, of which 2 are features. We can also plot the task using the mlr3viz package, which gives a graphical summary of its properties: library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) autoplot(task_mtcars, type = &quot;pairs&quot;) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;GGally&#39;: ## method from ## +.gg ggplot2 2.2.3 Predefined tasks mlr3 ships with a few predefined machine learning tasks. All tasks are stored in an R6 Dictionary (a key-value store) named mlr_tasks. Printing it gives the keys (the names of the datasets): mlr_tasks ## &lt;DictionaryTask&gt; with 10 stored values ## Keys: boston_housing, breast_cancer, german_credit, iris, mtcars, pima, ## sonar, spam, wine, zoo We can get a more informative summary of the example tasks by converting the dictionary to a data.table() object: library(&quot;data.table&quot;) as.data.table(mlr_tasks) ## key task_type nrow ncol lgl int dbl chr fct ord pxc ## 1: boston_housing regr 506 19 0 3 13 0 2 0 0 ## 2: breast_cancer classif 683 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 ## 3: german_credit classif 1000 21 0 3 0 0 14 3 0 ## 4: iris classif 150 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 ## 5: mtcars regr 32 11 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 ## 6: pima classif 768 9 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 ## 7: sonar classif 208 61 0 0 60 0 0 0 0 ## 8: spam classif 4601 58 0 0 57 0 0 0 0 ## 9: wine classif 178 14 0 2 11 0 0 0 0 ## 10: zoo classif 101 17 15 1 0 0 0 0 0 In the above display, the columns “lgl” (logical), “int” (integer), “dbl” (double), “chr” (character), “fct” (factor) and “ord” (ordinal) display the number of features (or columns) in the dataset with the corresponding datatype. To get a task from the dictionary, one can use the $get() method from the mlr_tasks class and assign the return value to a new object. For example, to use the iris data set for classification: task_iris = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) print(task_iris) ## &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; (150 x 5) ## * Target: Species ## * Properties: multiclass ## * Features (4): ## - dbl (4): Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width Alternatively, you can also use the convenience function tsk(), which also constructs a task from the dictionary. tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) ## &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; (150 x 5) ## * Target: Species ## * Properties: multiclass ## * Features (4): ## - dbl (4): Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width 2.2.4 Task API All task properties and characteristics can be queried using the task’s public fields and methods (see Task). Methods are also used to change the behavior of the task. 2.2.4.1 Retrieving Data The data stored in a task can be retrieved directly from fields, for example: task_iris$nrow ## [1] 150 task_iris$ncol ## [1] 5 More information can be obtained through methods of the object, for example: task_iris$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 ## --- ## 146: virginica 5.2 2.3 6.7 3.0 ## 147: virginica 5.0 1.9 6.3 2.5 ## 148: virginica 5.2 2.0 6.5 3.0 ## 149: virginica 5.4 2.3 6.2 3.4 ## 150: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 In mlr3, each row (observation) has a unique identifier, stored as an integer(). These can be passed as arguments to the $data() method to select specific rows: head(task_iris$row_ids) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 # retrieve data for rows with ids 1, 51, and 101 task_iris$data(rows = c(1, 51, 101)) ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: versicolor 4.7 1.4 7.0 3.2 ## 3: virginica 6.0 2.5 6.3 3.3 Similarly, target and feature columns also have unique identifiers, i.e. names. These names are stored in the public slots $feature_names and $target_names. Here “target” refers to the variable we want to predict and “feature” to the predictors for the task. task_iris$feature_names ## [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; task_iris$target_names ## [1] &quot;Species&quot; The row_ids and column names can be combined when selecting a subset of the data: # retrieve data for rows 1, 51, and 101 and only select column &quot;Species&quot; task_iris$data(rows = c(1, 51, 101), cols = &quot;Species&quot;) ## Species ## 1: setosa ## 2: versicolor ## 3: virginica To extract the complete data from the task, one can simply convert it to a data.table: summary(as.data.table(task_iris)) ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## setosa :50 Min. :1.00 Min. :0.1 Min. :4.30 Min. :2.00 ## versicolor:50 1st Qu.:1.60 1st Qu.:0.3 1st Qu.:5.10 1st Qu.:2.80 ## virginica :50 Median :4.35 Median :1.3 Median :5.80 Median :3.00 ## Mean :3.76 Mean :1.2 Mean :5.84 Mean :3.06 ## 3rd Qu.:5.10 3rd Qu.:1.8 3rd Qu.:6.40 3rd Qu.:3.30 ## Max. :6.90 Max. :2.5 Max. :7.90 Max. :4.40 2.2.4.2 Roles (Rows and Columns) It is possible to assign roles to rows and columns. These roles affect the behavior of the task for different operations. Furthermore, these roles provide additional meta-data for it. For example, the previously-constructed mtcars task has the following column roles: print(task_mtcars$col_roles) ## $feature ## [1] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; ## ## $target ## [1] &quot;mpg&quot; ## ## $name ## character(0) ## ## $order ## character(0) ## ## $stratum ## character(0) ## ## $group ## character(0) ## ## $weight ## character(0) To add the row names of mtcars as an additional feature, we first add them to the data table and then recreate the task. # with `keep.rownames`, data.table stores the row names in an extra column &quot;rn&quot; data = as.data.table(mtcars[, 1:3], keep.rownames = TRUE) task = TaskRegr$new(id = &quot;cars&quot;, backend = data, target = &quot;mpg&quot;) # there is a new feature called &quot;rn&quot; task$feature_names ## [1] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;rn&quot; The row names are now a feature whose values are stored in the column \"rn\". We include this column here for educational purposes only. Generally speaking, there is no point in having a feature that uniquely identifies each row. Furthermore, the character data type will cause problems with many types of machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, the identifier may be useful to label points in plots and identify outliers. To use the new column in the current example, we will change the role of the \"rn\" column and remove it from the set of active features. This is done by simply modifying the field $col_roles, which is a named list of vectors of column names. Each vector in this list corresponds to a column role, and the column names contained in that vector are designated as having that role. Supported column roles can be found in the manual of Task. # supported column roles, see ?Task names(task$col_roles) ## [1] &quot;feature&quot; &quot;target&quot; &quot;name&quot; &quot;order&quot; &quot;stratum&quot; &quot;group&quot; &quot;weight&quot; # assign column &quot;rn&quot; the role &quot;name&quot; task$col_roles$name = &quot;rn&quot; # remove &quot;rn&quot; from role &quot;feature&quot; task$col_roles$feature = setdiff(task$col_roles$feature, &quot;rn&quot;) # &quot;rn&quot; not listed as feature anymore task$feature_names ## [1] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; # &quot;rn&quot; also does not appear anymore when we access the data task$data(rows = 1:2) ## mpg cyl disp ## 1: 21 6 160 ## 2: 21 6 160 task$head(2) ## mpg cyl disp ## 1: 21 6 160 ## 2: 21 6 160 Changing the role does not change the underlying data. Changing the role only changes the view on it. The data is not copied in the code above. The view is changed in-place though, i.e. the task object itself is modified. Just like columns, it is also possible to assign different roles to rows. Rows can have two different roles: Role use: Rows that are generally available for model fitting (although they may also be used as test set in resampling). This role is the default role. Role validation: Rows that are not used for training. Rows that have missing values in the target column during task creation are automatically set to the validation role. There are several reasons to hold some observations back or treat them differently: It is often good practice to validate the final model on an external validation set to identify possible overfitting. Some observations may be unlabeled, e.g. in competitions like Kaggle. These observations cannot be used for training a model, but can be used to get predictions. 2.2.4.3 Task Mutators As shown above, modifying $col_roles or $row_roles changes the view on the data. The additional convenience method $filter() subsets the current view based on row ids and $select() subsets the view based on feature names. task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) task$select(c(&quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Length&quot;)) # keep only these features task$filter(1:3) # keep only these rows task$head() ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 4.7 3.2 While the methods discussed above allow to subset the data, the methods $rbind() and $cbind() allow to add extra rows and columns to a task. Again, the original data is not changed. The additional rows or columns are only added to the view of the data. task$cbind(data.table(foo = letters[1:3])) # add column foo task$head() ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width foo ## 1: setosa 5.1 3.5 a ## 2: setosa 4.9 3.0 b ## 3: setosa 4.7 3.2 c 2.2.5 Plotting Tasks The mlr3viz package provides plotting facilities for many classes implemented in mlr3. The available plot types depend on the inherited class, but all plots are returned as ggplot2 objects which can be easily customized. For classification tasks (inheriting from TaskClassif), see the documentation of mlr3viz::autoplot.TaskClassif for the implemented plot types. Here are some examples to get an impression: library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) # get the pima indians task task = tsk(&quot;pima&quot;) # subset task to only use the 3 first features task$select(head(task$feature_names, 3)) # default plot: class frequencies autoplot(task) # pairs plot (requires package GGally) autoplot(task, type = &quot;pairs&quot;) # duo plot (requires package GGally) autoplot(task, type = &quot;duo&quot;) Of course, you can do the same for regression tasks (inheriting from TaskRegr) as documented in mlr3viz::autoplot.TaskRegr: library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) # get the mtcars task task = tsk(&quot;mtcars&quot;) # subset task to only use the 3 first features task$select(head(task$feature_names, 3)) # default plot: boxplot of target variable autoplot(task) # pairs plot (requires package GGally) autoplot(task, type = &quot;pairs&quot;) "],["learners.html", "2.3 Learners", " 2.3 Learners Objects of class mlr3::Learner provide a unified interface to many popular machine learning algorithms in R. They consist of methods to train and predict a model for a mlr3::Task and provide meta-information about the learners, such as the hyperparameters you can set. The package ships with a minimal set of classification and regression learners to avoid lots of dependencies: mlr_learners_classif.featureless: Simple baseline classification learner, constantly predicts the label that is most frequent in the training set. mlr_learners_classif.rpart: Single classification tree from rpart. mlr_learners_regr.featureless: Simple baseline regression learner, constantly predicts with the mean. mlr_learners_regr.rpart: Single regression tree from rpart. Some of the most popular learners are connected via the mlr3learners package: (penalized) linear and logistic regression \\(k\\)-Nearest Neighbors regression and classification Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Naive Bayes Support-Vector machines Gradient Boosting Random Regression Forests and Random Classification Forests Kriging More learners are collected in the mlr3extralearners repository. A full list of implemented learners across is given in this interactive list and also via mlr3extralearners::list_mlr3learners(). The latest build status of all learners is listed here. Below a graphical illustration of the role of a learner: The base class of each learner is Learner, specialized for regression as LearnerRegr and for classification as LearnerClassif. In contrast to the Task, the creation of a custom Learner is usually not required and a more advanced topic. Hence, we refer the reader to Section 6.1 and proceed with an overview of the interface of already implemented learners. 2.3.1 Predefined Learners Similar to mlr_tasks, the Dictionary mlr_learners can be queried for available learners: library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) mlr_learners ## &lt;DictionaryLearner&gt; with 28 stored values ## Keys: classif.cv_glmnet, classif.debug, classif.featureless, ## classif.glmnet, classif.kknn, classif.lda, classif.log_reg, ## classif.multinom, classif.naive_bayes, classif.qda, classif.ranger, ## classif.rpart, classif.svm, classif.xgboost, regr.cv_glmnet, ## regr.featureless, regr.glmnet, regr.kknn, regr.km, regr.lm, ## regr.ranger, regr.rpart, regr.svm, regr.xgboost, surv.cv_glmnet, ## surv.glmnet, surv.ranger, surv.xgboost Each learner has the following information: feature_types: the type of features the learner can deal with. packages: the packages required to train a model with this learner and make predictions. properties: additional properties and capabilities. For example, a learner has the property “missings” if it is able to handle missing feature values, and “importance” if it computes and allows to extract data on the relative importance of the features. A complete list of these is available in the mlr3 reference on regression learners and classification learners. predict_types: possible prediction types. For example, a classification learner can predict labels (“response”) or probabilities (“prob”). For a complete list of possible predict types see the mlr3 reference. For a tabular overview of integrated learners, see Section 9.1. You can get a specific learner using its id, listed under key in the dictionary: learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) print(learner) ## &lt;LearnerClassifRpart:classif.rpart&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: xval=0 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights The field param_set stores a description of the hyperparameters the learner has, their ranges, defaults, and current values: learner$param_set ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: minsplit ParamInt 1 Inf 20 ## 2: minbucket ParamInt 1 Inf &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 3: cp ParamDbl 0 1 0.01 ## 4: maxcompete ParamInt 0 Inf 4 ## 5: maxsurrogate ParamInt 0 Inf 5 ## 6: maxdepth ParamInt 1 30 30 ## 7: usesurrogate ParamInt 0 2 2 ## 8: surrogatestyle ParamInt 0 1 0 ## 9: xval ParamInt 0 Inf 10 0 ## 10: keep_model ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE FALSE The set of current hyperparameter values is stored in the values field of the param_set field. You can change the current hyperparameter values by assigning a named list to this field: learner$param_set$values = list(cp = 0.01, xval = 0) learner ## &lt;LearnerClassifRpart:classif.rpart&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: cp=0.01, xval=0 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights Note that this operation just overwrites all previously set parameters. If you just want to add or update hyperparameters, you can use mlr3misc::insert_named(): learner$param_set$values = mlr3misc::insert_named( learner$param_set$values, list(cp = 0.02, minsplit = 2) ) learner ## &lt;LearnerClassifRpart:classif.rpart&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: cp=0.02, xval=0, minsplit=2 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights This updates cp to 0.02, sets minsplit to 2 and keeps the previously set parameter xval. Again, there is an alternative to writing down the lengthy mlr_learners$get() part: lrn(). This function additionally allows to construct learners with specific hyperparameters or settings of a different identifier in one go: lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, id = &quot;rp&quot;, cp = 0.001) ## &lt;LearnerClassifRpart:rp&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: xval=0, cp=0.001 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights If you pass hyperparameters here, they are added to the parameters in a insert_named()-fashion. "],["train-predict.html", "2.4 Train and Predict", " 2.4 Train and Predict In this section, we explain how tasks and learners can be used to train a model and predict to a new dataset. The concept is demonstrated on a supervised classification using the iris dataset and the rpart learner, which builds a singe classification tree. Training a learner means fitting a model to a given data set. Subsequently, we want to predict the label for new observations. These predictions are compared to the ground truth values in order to assess the predictive performance of the model. 2.4.1 Creating Task and Learner Objects The first step is to generate the following mlr3 objects from the task dictionary and the learner dictionary, respectively: The classification task: task = tsk(&quot;sonar&quot;) A learner for the classification tree: learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) 2.4.2 Setting up the train/test splits of the data It is common to train on a majority of the data. Here we use 80% of all available observations and predict on the remaining 20%. For this purpose, we create two index vectors: train_set = sample(task$nrow, 0.8 * task$nrow) test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train_set) In Section 2.5 we will learn how mlr3 can automatically create training and test sets based on different resampling strategies. 2.4.3 Training the learner The field $model stores the model that is produced in the training step. Before the $train() method is called on a learner object, this field is NULL: learner$model ## NULL Next, the classification tree is trained using the train set of the iris task by calling the $train() method of the Learner: learner$train(task, row_ids = train_set) This operation modifies the learner in-place. We can now access the stored model via the field $model: print(learner$model) ## n= 166 ## ## node), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob) ## * denotes terminal node ## ## 1) root 166 76 M (0.54217 0.45783) ## 2) V11&gt;=0.1704 108 30 M (0.72222 0.27778) ## 4) V52&gt;=0.00675 91 18 M (0.80220 0.19780) ## 8) V7&lt; 0.2092 78 10 M (0.87179 0.12821) * ## 9) V7&gt;=0.2092 13 5 R (0.38462 0.61538) * ## 5) V52&lt; 0.00675 17 5 R (0.29412 0.70588) * ## 3) V11&lt; 0.1704 58 12 R (0.20690 0.79310) ## 6) V5&gt;=0.0696 14 4 M (0.71429 0.28571) * ## 7) V5&lt; 0.0696 44 2 R (0.04545 0.95455) * 2.4.4 Predicting After the model has been trained, we use the remaining part of the data for prediction. Remember that we initially split the data in train_set and test_set. prediction = learner$predict(task, row_ids = test_set) print(prediction) ## &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 42 observations: ## row_id truth response ## 7 R M ## 17 R M ## 26 R R ## --- ## 190 M M ## 193 M M ## 197 M M The $predict() method of the Learner returns a Prediction object. More precisely, a LearnerClassif returns a PredictionClassif object. A prediction objects holds the row ids of the test data, the respective true label of the target column and the respective predictions. The simplest way to extract this information is by converting the Prediction object to a data.table(): head(as.data.table(prediction)) ## row_id truth response ## 1: 7 R M ## 2: 17 R M ## 3: 26 R R ## 4: 27 R M ## 5: 28 R R ## 6: 32 R M For classification, you can also extract the confusion matrix: prediction$confusion ## truth ## response M R ## M 14 10 ## R 7 11 2.4.5 Changing the Predict Type Classification learners default to predicting the class label. However, many classifiers additionally also tell you how sure they are about the predicted label by providing posterior probabilities. To switch to predicting these probabilities, the predict_type field of a LearnerClassif must be changed from \"response\" to \"prob\" before training: learner$predict_type = &quot;prob&quot; # re-fit the model learner$train(task, row_ids = train_set) # rebuild prediction object prediction = learner$predict(task, row_ids = test_set) The prediction object now contains probabilities for all class labels: # data.table conversion head(as.data.table(prediction)) ## row_id truth response prob.M prob.R ## 1: 7 R M 0.87179 0.1282 ## 2: 17 R M 0.87179 0.1282 ## 3: 26 R R 0.04545 0.9545 ## 4: 27 R M 0.71429 0.2857 ## 5: 28 R R 0.04545 0.9545 ## 6: 32 R M 0.87179 0.1282 # directly access the predicted labels: head(prediction$response) ## [1] M M R M R M ## Levels: M R # directly access the matrix of probabilities: head(prediction$prob) ## M R ## [1,] 0.87179 0.1282 ## [2,] 0.87179 0.1282 ## [3,] 0.04545 0.9545 ## [4,] 0.71429 0.2857 ## [5,] 0.04545 0.9545 ## [6,] 0.87179 0.1282 Analogously to predicting probabilities, many regression learners support the extraction of standard error estimates by setting the predict type to \"se\". 2.4.6 Plotting Predictions Analogously to plotting tasks, mlr3viz provides a autoplot() method for Prediction objects. All available types are listed on the manual page of autoplot.PredictionClassif() or autoplot.PredictionClassif(), respectively. library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;sonar&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) learner$train(task) prediction = learner$predict(task) autoplot(prediction) autoplot(prediction, type = &quot;roc&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) local({ # we do this locally to not overwrite the objects from previous chunks task = tsk(&quot;mtcars&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;regr.lm&quot;) learner$train(task) prediction = learner$predict(task) autoplot(prediction) }) 2.4.7 Performance assessment The last step of modeling is usually the performance assessment. To assess the quality of the predictions, the predicted labels are compared with the true labels. How this comparison is calculated is defined by a measure, which is given by a Measure object. Note that if the prediction was made on a dataset without the target column, i.e. without true labels, then no performance can be calculated. Predefined available measures are stored in mlr_measures (with convenience getter msr()): mlr_measures ## &lt;DictionaryMeasure&gt; with 54 stored values ## Keys: classif.acc, classif.auc, classif.bacc, classif.bbrier, ## classif.ce, classif.costs, classif.dor, classif.fbeta, classif.fdr, ## classif.fn, classif.fnr, classif.fomr, classif.fp, classif.fpr, ## classif.logloss, classif.mbrier, classif.mcc, classif.npv, ## classif.ppv, classif.prauc, classif.precision, classif.recall, ## classif.sensitivity, classif.specificity, classif.tn, classif.tnr, ## classif.tp, classif.tpr, debug, oob_error, regr.bias, regr.ktau, ## regr.mae, regr.mape, regr.maxae, regr.medae, regr.medse, regr.mse, ## regr.msle, regr.pbias, regr.rae, regr.rmse, regr.rmsle, regr.rrse, ## regr.rse, regr.rsq, regr.sae, regr.smape, regr.srho, regr.sse, ## selected_features, time_both, time_predict, time_train We choose accuracy (classif.acc) as a specific performance measure and call the method $score() of the Prediction object to quantify the predictive performance. measure = msr(&quot;classif.acc&quot;) prediction$score(measure) ## classif.acc ## 0.875 Note that, if no measure is specified, classification defaults to classification error (classif.ce) and regression defaults to the mean squared error (regr.mse). "],["resampling.html", "2.5 Resampling", " 2.5 Resampling Resampling strategies are usually used to assess the performance of a learning algorithm. mlr3 entails the following predefined resampling strategies: cross validation (\"cv\"), leave-one-out cross validation (\"loo\"), repeated cross validation (\"repeated_cv\"), bootstrapping (\"bootstrap\"), subsampling (\"subsampling\"), holdout (\"holdout\"), in-sample resampling (\"insample\"), and custom resampling (\"custom\"). The following sections provide guidance on how to set and select a resampling strategy and how to subsequently instantiate the resampling process. Below you can find a graphical illustration of the resampling process: 2.5.1 Settings In this example we use the iris task and a simple classification tree from the rpart package. task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) When performing resampling with a dataset, we first need to define which approach should be used. mlr3 resampling strategies and their parameters can be queried by looking at the data.table output of the mlr_resamplings dictionary: as.data.table(mlr_resamplings) ## key params iters ## 1: bootstrap repeats,ratio 30 ## 2: custom 0 ## 3: cv folds 10 ## 4: holdout ratio 1 ## 5: insample 1 ## 6: loo NA ## 7: repeated_cv repeats,folds 100 ## 8: subsampling repeats,ratio 30 Additional resampling methods for special use cases will be available via extension packages, such as mlr3spatiotemporal for spatial data (still in development). The model fit conducted in the train/predict/score chapter is equivalent to a “holdout resampling”, so let’s consider this one first. Again, we can retrieve elements from the dictionary mlr_resamplings via $get() or with the convenience functionrsmp(): resampling = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;) print(resampling) ## &lt;ResamplingHoldout&gt; with 1 iterations ## * Instantiated: FALSE ## * Parameters: ratio=0.6667 Note that the $is_instantiated field is set to FALSE. This means we did not actually apply the strategy on a dataset yet. Applying the strategy on a dataset is done in the next section Instantiation. By default we get a .66/.33 split of the data. There are two ways in which the ratio can be changed: Overwriting the slot in $param_set$values using a named list: resampling$param_set$values = list(ratio = 0.8) Specifying the resampling parameters directly during construction: rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;, ratio = 0.8) ## &lt;ResamplingHoldout&gt; with 1 iterations ## * Instantiated: FALSE ## * Parameters: ratio=0.8 2.5.2 Instantiation So far we just set the stage and selected the resampling strategy. To actually perform the splitting and obtain indices for the training and the test split the resampling needs a Task. By calling the method instantiate(), we split the indices of the data into indices for training and test sets. These resulting indices are stored in the Resampling object: resampling = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3L) resampling$instantiate(task) resampling$iters ## [1] 3 str(resampling$train_set(1)) ## int [1:100] 4 5 9 18 21 26 27 28 29 30 ... str(resampling$test_set(1)) ## int [1:50] 2 7 8 10 11 17 19 23 25 33 ... 2.5.3 Execution With a Task, a Learner and a Resampling object we can call resample(), which fits the learner to the task at hand according to the given resampling strategy. This in turn creates a ResampleResult object. Before we go into more detail, let’s change the resampling to a “3-fold cross-validation” to better illustrate what operations are possible with a ResampleResult. Additionally, when actually fitting the models, we tell resample() to keep the fitted models by setting the store_models option to TRUE: task = tsk(&quot;pima&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, maxdepth = 3, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) resampling = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3L) rr = resample(task, learner, resampling, store_models = TRUE) print(rr) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: pima ## * Learner: classif.rpart ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations The following operations are supported with ResampleResult objects: Calculate the average performance across all resampling iterations: rr$aggregate(msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;)) ## classif.ce ## 0.2682 Extract the performance for the individual resampling iterations: rr$score(msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;)) ## task task_id learner learner_id ## 1: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; pima &lt;LearnerClassifRpart[33]&gt; classif.rpart ## 2: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; pima &lt;LearnerClassifRpart[33]&gt; classif.rpart ## 3: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; pima &lt;LearnerClassifRpart[33]&gt; classif.rpart ## resampling resampling_id iteration prediction ## 1: &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; cv 1 &lt;PredictionClassif[19]&gt; ## 2: &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; cv 2 &lt;PredictionClassif[19]&gt; ## 3: &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; cv 3 &lt;PredictionClassif[19]&gt; ## classif.ce ## 1: 0.2734 ## 2: 0.2383 ## 3: 0.2930 Check for warnings or errors: rr$warnings ## Empty data.table (0 rows and 2 cols): iteration,msg rr$errors ## Empty data.table (0 rows and 2 cols): iteration,msg Extract and inspect the resampling splits: rr$resampling ## &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; with 3 iterations ## * Instantiated: TRUE ## * Parameters: folds=3 rr$resampling$iters ## [1] 3 str(rr$resampling$test_set(1)) ## int [1:256] 1 5 7 12 13 15 17 19 21 23 ... str(rr$resampling$train_set(1)) ## int [1:512] 4 6 11 14 16 22 27 30 31 36 ...

This can be achieved by manually instantiating the instance before fitting model(s) on it. Hint: If your aim is to compare different Task, Learner or Resampling, you are better off using the benchmark() function which is covered in the next section on benchmarking. It is a wrapper around resample(), simplifying the handling of large comparison grids. If you discover this only after you’ve run multiple resample() calls, don’t worry. You can combine multiple ResampleResult objects into a BenchmarkResult (also explained in the section benchmarking). 2.5.4 Custom resampling Sometimes it is necessary to perform resampling with custom splits. If you want to do that because you are coming from a specific modeling field, first take a look at the mlr3 extension packages, to check wheter your resampling method has been implemented already. If this is not the case, feel welcome to extend an existing package or create your own extension package. A manual resampling instance can be created using the \"custom\" template. resampling = rsmp(&quot;custom&quot;) resampling$instantiate(task, train = list(c(1:10, 51:60, 101:110)), test = list(c(11:20, 61:70, 111:120)) ) resampling$iters ## [1] 1 resampling$train_set(1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 ## [20] 60 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 resampling$test_set(1) ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 ## [20] 70 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 2.5.5 Plotting Resample Results Again, mlr3viz provides a autoplot() method. library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) autoplot(rr) autoplot(rr, type = &quot;roc&quot;) All available plot types are listed on the manual page of autoplot.ResampleResult(). "],["benchmarking.html", "2.6 Benchmarking", " 2.6 Benchmarking Comparing the performance of different learners on multiple tasks and/or different resampling schemes is a common task. This operation is usually referred to as “benchmarking” in the field of machine-learning. The mlr3 package offers the benchmark() convenience function. 2.6.1 Design Creation In mlr3 we require you to supply a “design” of your benchmark experiment. A “design” is essentially a matrix of settings you want to execute. It consists of unique combinations of Task, Learner and Resampling triplets. Here, we call benchmark() to perform a single holdout split on a single task and two learners. We use the benchmark_grid() function to create an exhaustive design and instantiate the resampling properly, so that all learners are executed on the same train/test split for each task: library(&quot;data.table&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) design = benchmark_grid( tasks = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;), learners = list(lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;), lrn(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;)), resamplings = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;) ) print(design) ## task learner resampling ## 1: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingHoldout[19]&gt; ## 2: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingHoldout[19]&gt; bmr = benchmark(design) Instead of using benchmark_grid() you could also create the design manually as a data.table and use the full flexibility of the benchmark() function. The design does not have to be exhaustive, e.g. it can also contain a different learner for each task. However, you should note that benchmark_grid() makes sure to instantiate the resamplings for each task. If you create the design manually, even if the same task is used multiple times, the train/test splits will be different for each row of the design if you do not manually instantiate the resampling before creating the design. Let’s construct a more complex design to show the full capabilities of the benchmark() function. # get some example tasks tasks = lapply(c(&quot;german_credit&quot;, &quot;sonar&quot;), tsk) # get some learners and for all learners ... # * predict probabilities # * predict also on the training set library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) learners = c(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;, &quot;classif.rpart&quot;, &quot;classif.ranger&quot;, &quot;classif.kknn&quot;) learners = lapply(learners, lrn, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;, predict_sets = c(&quot;train&quot;, &quot;test&quot;)) # compare via 3-fold cross validation resamplings = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) # create a BenchmarkDesign object design = benchmark_grid(tasks, learners, resamplings) print(design) ## task learner resampling ## 1: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 2: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 3: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRanger[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 4: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifKKNN[31]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 5: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 6: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 7: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRanger[33]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; ## 8: &lt;TaskClassif[45]&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifKKNN[31]&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV[19]&gt; 2.6.2 Execution and Aggregation of Results After the benchmark design is ready, we can directly call benchmark(): # execute the benchmark bmr = benchmark(design) Note that we did not instantiate the resampling instance manually. benchmark_grid() took care of it for us: Each resampling strategy is instantiated once for each task during the construction of the exhaustive grid. Once the benchmarking is done, we can aggregate the performance with $aggregate(): # measures: # * area under the curve (auc) on training # * area under the curve (auc) on test measures = list( msr(&quot;classif.auc&quot;, id = &quot;auc_train&quot;, predict_sets = &quot;train&quot;), msr(&quot;classif.auc&quot;, id = &quot;auc_test&quot;) ) bmr$aggregate(measures) ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.featureless cv ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.rpart cv ## 3: 3 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.ranger cv ## 4: 4 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.kknn cv ## 5: 5 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.featureless cv ## 6: 6 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.rpart cv ## 7: 7 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.ranger cv ## 8: 8 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.kknn cv ## iters auc_train auc_test ## 1: 3 0.5000 0.5000 ## 2: 3 0.8042 0.7011 ## 3: 3 0.9987 0.7959 ## 4: 3 0.9873 0.6936 ## 5: 3 0.5000 0.5000 ## 6: 3 0.9243 0.7817 ## 7: 3 1.0000 0.9342 ## 8: 3 0.9987 0.9278 We can aggregate the results even further. For example, we might be interested to know which learner performed best over all tasks simultaneously. Simply aggregating the performances with the mean is usually not statistically sound. Instead, we calculate the rank statistic for each learner grouped by task. Then the calculated ranks grouped by learner are aggregated with data.table. Since the AUC needs to be maximized, we multiply the values by \\(-1\\) so that the best learner has a rank of \\(1\\). tab = bmr$aggregate(measures) print(tab) ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.featureless cv ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.rpart cv ## 3: 3 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.ranger cv ## 4: 4 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.kknn cv ## 5: 5 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.featureless cv ## 6: 6 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.rpart cv ## 7: 7 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.ranger cv ## 8: 8 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; sonar classif.kknn cv ## iters auc_train auc_test ## 1: 3 0.5000 0.5000 ## 2: 3 0.8042 0.7011 ## 3: 3 0.9987 0.7959 ## 4: 3 0.9873 0.6936 ## 5: 3 0.5000 0.5000 ## 6: 3 0.9243 0.7817 ## 7: 3 1.0000 0.9342 ## 8: 3 0.9987 0.9278 # group by levels of task_id, return columns: # - learner_id # - rank of col &#39;-auc_train&#39; (per level of learner_id) # - rank of col &#39;-auc_test&#39; (per level of learner_id) ranks = tab[, .(learner_id, rank_train = rank(-auc_train), rank_test = rank(-auc_test)), by = task_id] print(ranks) ## task_id learner_id rank_train rank_test ## 1: german_credit classif.featureless 4 4 ## 2: german_credit classif.rpart 3 2 ## 3: german_credit classif.ranger 1 1 ## 4: german_credit classif.kknn 2 3 ## 5: sonar classif.featureless 4 4 ## 6: sonar classif.rpart 3 3 ## 7: sonar classif.ranger 1 1 ## 8: sonar classif.kknn 2 2 # group by levels of learner_id, return columns: # - mean rank of col &#39;rank_train&#39; (per level of learner_id) # - mean rank of col &#39;rank_test&#39; (per level of learner_id) ranks = ranks[, .(mrank_train = mean(rank_train), mrank_test = mean(rank_test)), by = learner_id] # print the final table, ordered by mean rank of AUC test ranks[order(mrank_test)] ## learner_id mrank_train mrank_test ## 1: classif.ranger 1 1.0 ## 2: classif.rpart 3 2.5 ## 3: classif.kknn 2 2.5 ## 4: classif.featureless 4 4.0 Unsurprisingly, the featureless learner is outperformed on both training and test set. 2.6.3 Plotting Benchmark Results Analogously to plotting tasks, predictions or resample results, mlr3viz also provides a autoplot() method for benchmark results. library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) autoplot(bmr) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) We can also plot ROC curves. To do so, we first need to filter the BenchmarkResult to only contain a single Task: autoplot(bmr$clone()$filter(task_id = &quot;german_credit&quot;), type = &quot;roc&quot;) All available types are listed on the manual page of autoplot.BenchmarkResult(). 2.6.4 Extracting ResampleResults A BenchmarkResult object is essentially a collection of multiple ResampleResult objects. As these are stored in a column of the aggregated data.table(), we can easily extract them: tab = bmr$aggregate(measures) rr = tab[task_id == &quot;german_credit&quot; &amp; learner_id == &quot;classif.ranger&quot;]$resample_result[[1]] print(rr) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: german_credit ## * Learner: classif.ranger ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations We can now investigate this resampling and even single resampling iterations using one of the approaches shown in the previous section: measure = msr(&quot;classif.auc&quot;) rr$aggregate(measure) ## classif.auc ## 0.7959 # get the iteration with worst AUC perf = rr$score(measure) i = which.min(perf$classif.auc) # get the corresponding learner and train set print(rr$learners[[i]]) ## &lt;LearnerClassifRanger:classif.ranger&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: list() ## * Packages: ranger ## * Predict Type: prob ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, multiclass, oob_error, twoclass, weights head(rr$resampling$train_set(i)) ## [1] 2 5 9 10 14 17 2.6.5 Converting and Merging ResampleResults It is also possible to cast a single ResampleResult to a BenchmarkResult using the converter as_benchmark_result(). task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) resampling = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;)$instantiate(task) rr1 = resample(task, lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;), resampling) rr2 = resample(task, lrn(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;), resampling) # Cast both ResampleResults to BenchmarkResults bmr1 = as_benchmark_result(rr1) bmr2 = as_benchmark_result(rr2) # Merge 2nd BMR into the first BMR bmr1$combine(bmr2) bmr1 ## &lt;BenchmarkResult&gt; of 2 rows with 2 resampling runs ## nr task_id learner_id resampling_id iters warnings errors ## 1 iris classif.rpart holdout 1 0 0 ## 2 iris classif.featureless holdout 1 0 0 "],["binary-classification.html", "2.7 Binary classification", " 2.7 Binary classification Classification problems with a target variable containing only two classes are called “binary”. For such binary target variables, you can specify the positive class within the classification task object during task creation. If not explicitly set during construction, the positive class defaults to the first level of the target variable. # during construction data(&quot;Sonar&quot;, package = &quot;mlbench&quot;) task = TaskClassif$new(id = &quot;Sonar&quot;, Sonar, target = &quot;Class&quot;, positive = &quot;R&quot;) # switch positive class to level &#39;M&#39; task$positive = &quot;M&quot; 2.7.1 ROC Curve and Thresholds ROC Analysis, which stands for “receiver operating characteristics”, is a subfield of machine learning which studies the evaluation of binary prediction systems. We saw earlier that one can retrieve the confusion matrix of a Prediction by accessing the $confusion field: learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) pred = learner$train(task)$predict(task) C = pred$confusion print(C) ## truth ## response M R ## M 95 10 ## R 16 87 The confusion matrix contains the counts of correct and incorrect class assignments, grouped by class labels. The columns illustrate the true (observed) labels and the rows display the predicted labels. The positive is always the first row or column in the confusion matrix. Thus, the element in \\(C_{11}\\) is the number of times our model predicted the positive class and was right about it. Analogously, the element in \\(C_{22}\\) is the number of times our model predicted the negative class and was also right about it. The elements on the diagonal are called True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN). The element \\(C_{12}\\) is the number of times we falsely predicted a positive label, and is called False Positives (FP). The element \\(C_{21}\\) is called False Negatives (FN). We can now normalize in rows and columns of the confusion matrix to derive several informative metrics: True Positive Rate (TPR): How many of the true positives did we predict as positive? True Negative Rate (TNR): How many of the true negatives did we predict as negative? Positive Predictive Value PPV: If we predict positive how likely is it a true positive? Negative Predictive Value NPV: If we predict negative how likely is it a true negative? Source: Wikipedia It is difficult to achieve a high TPR and low FPR in conjunction, so one uses them for constructing the ROC Curve. We characterize a classifier by its TPR and FPR values and plot them in a coordinate system. The best classifier lies on the top-left corner. The worst classifier lies at the diagonal. Classifiers lying on the diagonal produce random labels (with different proportions). If each positive \\(x\\) will be randomly classified with 25% as “positive”, we get a TPR of 0.25. If we assign each negative \\(x\\) randomly to “positive” we get a FPR of 0.25. In practice, we should never obtain a classifier below the diagonal, as inverting the predicted labels will result in a reflection at the diagonal. A scoring classifier is a model which produces scores or probabilities, instead of discrete labels. To obtain probabilities from a learner in mlr3, you have to set predict_type = \"prob\" for a ref(\"LearnerClassif\"). Whether a classifier can predict probabilities is given in its $predict_types field. Thresholding flexibly converts measured probabilities to labels. Predict \\(1\\) (positive class) if \\(\\hat{f}(x) &gt; \\tau\\) else predict \\(0\\). Normally, one could use \\(\\tau = 0.5\\) to convert probabilities to labels, but for imbalanced or cost-sensitive situations another threshold could be more suitable. After thresholding, any metric defined on labels can be used. For mlr3 prediction objects, the ROC curve can easily be created with mlr3viz which relies on the precrec to calculate and plot ROC curves: library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) # TPR vs FPR / Sensitivity vs (1 - Specificity) ggplot2::autoplot(pred, type = &quot;roc&quot;) # Precision vs Recall ggplot2::autoplot(pred, type = &quot;prc&quot;) 2.7.2 Threshold Tuning "],["optimization.html", "3 Model Optimization", " 3 Model Optimization Model Tuning Machine learning algorithms have default values set for their hyperparameters. Irrespective, these hyperparameters need to be changed by the user to achieve optimal performance on the given dataset. A manual selection of hyperparameter values is not recommended as this approach rarely leads to the best performance. To substantiate the validity of the selected hyperparameters (= tuning), data-driven optimization is recommended. In order to tune a machine learning algorithm, one has to specify (1) the search space, (2) the optimization algorithm (aka tuning method), (3) an evaluation method, i.e., a resampling strategy and (4) a performance measure. In summary, the sub-chapter on tuning illustrates how to: undertake empirically sound hyperparameter selection select the optimizing algorithm trigger the tuning automate tuning This sub-chapter also requires the package mlr3tuning, an extension package which supports hyperparameter tuning. Feature Selection The second part of this chapter explains feature selection, also known as variable selection. Feature selection is the process of finding a subset of relevant features of the data. Some of the reasons to perform the selection: enhance the interpretability of the model, speed up model fitting or improve the learner performance by reducing noise in the data. In this book we focus mainly on the last aspect. Different approaches exist to identify the relevant features. In the sub-chapter on feature selection, we emphasize three methods: Filter algorithms select features independently of the learner according to a score. Variable importance filters select features that are important according to a learner. Wrapper methods iteratively select features to optimize a performance measure. Note, that filters do not require a learner. Variable importance filters require a learner that can calculate feature importance values once it is trained. The obtained importance values can be used to subset the data, which can then be used to train a learner. Wrapper methods can be used with any learner but need to train the learner multiple times. Nested Resampling In order to get a good estimate of generalization performance and avoid data leakage, both an outer (performance) and an inner (tuning/feature selection) resampling process are necessary. The following features are discussed in this chapter: Inner and outer resampling strategies in nested resampling The execution of nested resampling The evaluation of executed resampling iterations This sub-chapter will provide instructions on how to implement nested resampling, accounting for both inner and outer resampling in mlr3. "],["tuning.html", "3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning", " 3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning Hyperparameters are second-order parameters of machine learning models that, while often not explicitly optimized during the model estimation process, can have an important impact on the outcome and predictive performance of a model. Typically, hyperparameters are fixed before training a model. However, because the output of a model can be sensitive to the specification of hyperparameters, it is often recommended to make an informed decision about which hyperparameter settings may yield better model performance. In many cases, hyperparameter settings may be chosen a priori, but it can be advantageous to try different settings before fitting your model on the training data. This process is often called model ‘tuning’. Hyperparameter tuning is supported via the mlr3tuning extension package. Below you can find an illustration of the process: At the heart of mlr3tuning are the R6 classes: TuningInstanceSingleCrit, TuningInstanceMultiCrit: These two classes describe the tuning problem and store the results. Tuner: This class is the base class for implementations of tuning algorithms. 3.1.1 The TuningInstance* Classes The following sub-section examines the optimization of a simple classification tree on the Pima Indian Diabetes data set. task = tsk(&quot;pima&quot;) print(task) ## &lt;TaskClassif:pima&gt; (768 x 9) ## * Target: diabetes ## * Properties: twoclass ## * Features (8): ## - dbl (8): age, glucose, insulin, mass, pedigree, pregnant, pressure, ## triceps We use the classification tree from rpart and choose a subset of the hyperparameters we want to tune. This is often referred to as the “tuning space”. learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) learner$param_set ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: minsplit ParamInt 1 Inf 20 ## 2: minbucket ParamInt 1 Inf &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 3: cp ParamDbl 0 1 0.01 ## 4: maxcompete ParamInt 0 Inf 4 ## 5: maxsurrogate ParamInt 0 Inf 5 ## 6: maxdepth ParamInt 1 30 30 ## 7: usesurrogate ParamInt 0 2 2 ## 8: surrogatestyle ParamInt 0 1 0 ## 9: xval ParamInt 0 Inf 10 0 ## 10: keep_model ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE FALSE Here, we opt to tune two parameters: The complexity cp The termination criterion minsplit The tuning space needs to be bounded, therefore one has to set lower and upper bounds: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) tune_ps = ParamSet$new(list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1), ParamInt$new(&quot;minsplit&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 10) )) tune_ps ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: cp ParamDbl 0.001 0.1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 2: minsplit ParamInt 1.000 10.0 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; Next, we need to specify how to evaluate the performance. For this, we need to choose a resampling strategy and a performance measure. hout = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;) measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) Finally, one has to select the budget available, to solve this tuning instance. This is done by selecting one of the available Terminators: Terminate after a given time (TerminatorClockTime) Terminate after a given amount of iterations (TerminatorEvals) Terminate after a specific performance is reached (TerminatorPerfReached) Terminate when tuning does not improve (TerminatorStagnation) A combination of the above in an ALL or ANY fashion (TerminatorCombo) For this short introduction, we specify a budget of 20 evaluations and then put everything together into a TuningInstanceSingleCrit: library(&quot;mlr3tuning&quot;) evals20 = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 20) instance = TuningInstanceSingleCrit$new( task = task, learner = learner, resampling = hout, measure = measure, search_space = tune_ps, terminator = evals20 ) instance ## &lt;TuningInstanceSingleCrit&gt; ## * State: Not optimized ## * Objective: &lt;ObjectiveTuning:classif.rpart_on_pima&gt; ## * Search Space: ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: cp ParamDbl 0.001 0.1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 2: minsplit ParamInt 1.000 10.0 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## * Terminator: &lt;TerminatorEvals&gt; ## * Terminated: FALSE ## * Archive: ## &lt;ArchiveTuning&gt; ## Null data.table (0 rows and 0 cols) To start the tuning, we still need to select how the optimization should take place. In other words, we need to choose the optimization algorithm via the Tuner class. 3.1.2 The Tuner Class The following algorithms are currently implemented in mlr3tuning: Grid Search (TunerGridSearch) Random Search (TunerRandomSearch) (Bergstra and Bengio 2012) Generalized Simulated Annealing (TunerGenSA) Non-Linear Optimization (TunerNLoptr) In this example, we will use a simple grid search with a grid resolution of 5. tuner = tnr(&quot;grid_search&quot;, resolution = 5) Since we have only numeric parameters, TunerGridSearch will create an equidistant grid between the respective upper and lower bounds. As we have two hyperparameters with a resolution of 5, the two-dimensional grid consists of \\(5^2 = 25\\) configurations. Each configuration serves as a hyperparameter setting for the previously defined Learner and triggers a 3-fold cross validation on the task. All configurations will be examined by the tuner (in a random order), until either all configurations are evaluated or the Terminator signals that the budget is exhausted. 3.1.3 Triggering the Tuning To start the tuning, we simply pass the TuningInstanceSingleCrit to the $optimize() method of the initialized Tuner. The tuner proceeds as follows: The Tuner proposes at least one hyperparameter configuration (the Tuner may propose multiple points to improve parallelization, which can be controlled via the setting batch_size). For each configuration, the given Learner is fitted on the Task using the provided Resampling. All evaluations are stored in the archive of the TuningInstanceSingleCrit. The Terminator is queried if the budget is exhausted. If the budget is not exhausted, restart with 1) until it is. Determine the configuration with the best observed performance.

Note that predicting on observations present in the task, should be avoided. The model has seen these observations already during tuning and therefore results would be statistically biased. Hence, the resulting performance measure would be over-optimistic. Instead, to get statistically unbiased performance estimates for the current task, nested resampling is required. 3.1.4 Automating the Tuning The AutoTuner wraps a learner and augments it with an automatic tuning for a given set of hyperparameters. Because the AutoTuner itself inherits from the Learner base class, it can be used like any other learner. Analogously to the previous subsection, a new classification tree learner is created. This classification tree learner automatically tunes the parameters cp and minsplit using an inner resampling (holdout). We create a terminator which allows 10 evaluations, and use a simple random search as tuning algorithm: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3tuning&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) tune_ps = ParamSet$new(list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1), ParamInt$new(&quot;minsplit&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 10) )) terminator = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 10) tuner = tnr(&quot;random_search&quot;) at = AutoTuner$new( learner = learner, resampling = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;), measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;), search_space = tune_ps, terminator = terminator, tuner = tuner ) at ## &lt;AutoTuner:classif.rpart.tuned&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: xval=0 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights We can now use the learner like any other learner, calling the $train() and $predict() method. This time however, we pass it to benchmark() to compare the tuner to a classification tree without tuning. This way, the AutoTuner will do its resampling for tuning on the training set of the respective split of the outer resampling. The learner then undertakes predictions using the test set of the outer resampling. This yields unbiased performance measures, as the observations in the test set have not been used during tuning or fitting of the respective learner. This is called nested resampling. To compare the tuned learner with the learner that uses default values, we can use benchmark(): grid = benchmark_grid( task = tsk(&quot;pima&quot;), learner = list(at, lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)), resampling = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) ) # avoid console output from mlr3tuning logger = lgr::get_logger(&quot;bbotk&quot;) logger$set_threshold(&quot;warn&quot;) bmr = benchmark(grid) bmr$aggregate(msrs(c(&quot;classif.ce&quot;, &quot;time_train&quot;))) ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id iters ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; pima classif.rpart.tuned cv 3 ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; pima classif.rpart cv 3 ## classif.ce time_train ## 1: 0.2526 0 ## 2: 0.2461 0 Note that we do not expect any differences compared to the non-tuned approach for multiple reasons: the task is too easy the task is rather small, and thus prone to overfitting the tuning budget (10 evaluations) is small rpart does not benefit that much from tuning References "],["nested-resampling.html", "3.2 Nested Resampling", " 3.2 Nested Resampling In order to obtain unbiased performance estimates for learners, all parts of the model building (preprocessing and model selection steps) should be included in the resampling, i.e., repeated for every pair of training/test data. For steps that themselves require resampling like hyperparameter tuning or feature-selection (via the wrapper approach) this results in two nested resampling loops. The graphic above illustrates nested resampling for parameter tuning with 3-fold cross-validation in the outer and 4-fold cross-validation in the inner loop. In the outer resampling loop, we have three pairs of training/test sets. On each of these outer training sets parameter tuning is done, thereby executing the inner resampling loop. This way, we get one set of selected hyperparameters for each outer training set. Then the learner is fitted on each outer training set using the corresponding selected hyperparameters. Subsequently, we can evaluate the performance of the learner on the outer test sets. In mlr3, you can run nested resampling for free without programming any loops by using the mlr3tuning::AutoTuner class. This works as follows: Generate a wrapped Learner via class mlr3tuning::AutoTuner or mlr3filters::AutoSelect (not yet implemented). Specify all required settings - see section “Automating the Tuning” for help. Call function resample() or benchmark() with the created Learner. You can freely combine different inner and outer resampling strategies. A common setup is prediction and performance evaluation on a fixed outer test set. This can be achieved by passing the Resampling strategy (rsmp(\"holdout\")) as the outer resampling instance to either resample() or benchmark(). The inner resampling strategy could be a cross-validation one (rsmp(\"cv\")) as the sizes of the outer training sets might differ. Per default, the inner resample description is instantiated once for every outer training set. Note that nested resampling is computationally expensive. For this reason we use relatively small search spaces and a low number of resampling iterations in the examples shown below. In practice, you normally have to increase both. As this is computationally intensive you might want to have a look at the section on Parallelization. 3.2.1 Execution To optimize hyperparameters or conduct feature selection in a nested resampling you need to create learners using either: the AutoTuner class, or the mlr3filters::AutoSelect class (not yet implemented) We use the example from section “Automating the Tuning” and pipe the resulting learner into a resample() call. library(&quot;mlr3tuning&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) resampling = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;) measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new( params = list(paradox::ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1))) terminator = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 5) tuner = tnr(&quot;grid_search&quot;, resolution = 10) at = AutoTuner$new(learner, resampling, measure = measure, param_set, terminator, tuner = tuner) Now construct the resample() call: resampling_outer = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) rr = resample(task = task, learner = at, resampling = resampling_outer) ## INFO [19:27:26.986] Starting to optimize 1 parameter(s) with &#39;&lt;OptimizerGridSearch&gt;&#39;

Hyperband is a budget-oriented procedure, weeding out suboptimal performing configurations early on during a partially sequential training process, increasing tuning efficiency as a consequence. For this, a combination of incremental resource allocation and early stopping is used: As optimization progresses, computational resources are increased for more promising configurations, while less promising ones are terminated early. To give an introductory analogy, imagine two horse trainers are given eight untrained horses. Both trainers want to win the upcoming race, but they are only given 32 units of food. Given that each horse can be fed up to 8 units food (“maximum budget” per horse), there is not enough food for all the horses. It is critical to identify the most promising horses early, and give them enough food to improve. So, the trainers need to develop a strategy to split up the food in the best possible way. The first trainer is very optimistic and wants to explore the full capabilities of a horse, because he does not want to pass a judgement on a horse’s performance unless it has been fully trained. So, he divides his budget by the maximum amount he can give to a horse (lets say eight, so \\(32 / 8 = 4\\)) and randomly picks four horses - his budget simply is not enough to fully train more. Those four horses are then trained to their full capabilities, while the rest is set free. This way, the trainer is confident about choosing the best out of the four trained horses, but he might have overlooked the horse with the highest potential since he only focused on half of them. The other trainer is more creative and develops a different strategy. He thinks, if a horse is not performing well at the beginning, it will also not improve after further training. Based on this assumption, he decides to give one unit of food to each horse and observes how they develop. After the initial food is consumed, he checks their performance and kicks the slowest half out of his training regime. Then, he increases the available food for the remaining, further trains them until the food is consumed again, only to kick out the worst half once more. He repeats this until the one remaining horse gets the rest of the food. This means only one horse is fully trained, but on the flip side, he was able to start training with all eight horses. On race day, all the horses are put on the starting line. But which trainer will have the winning horse? The one, who tried to train a maximum amount of horses to their fullest? Or the other one, who made assumptions about the training progress of his horses? How the training phases may possibly look like is visualized in figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Visulization of how the training processes may look like. The left plot corresponds to the non-selective trainer, while the right one to the selective trainer. Hyperband works very similar in some ways, but also different in others. It is not embodied by one of the trainers in our analogy, but more by the person, who would pay them. Hyperband consists of several brackets, each bracket corresponding to a trainer, and we do not care about horses but about hyperparameter configurations of a machine learning algorithm. The budget is not in terms of food, but in terms of a hyperparameter of the learner that scales in some way with the computational effort. An example is the number of epochs we train a neural network, or the number of iterations in boosting. Furthermore, there are not only two brackets (or trainers), but several, each placed at a unique spot between fully explorative of later training stages and extremely selective, equal to higher exploration of early training stages. The level of selection aggressiveness is handled by a user-defined parameter called \\(\\eta\\). So, \\(1/\\eta\\) is the fraction of remaining configurations after a bracket removes his worst performing ones, but \\(\\eta\\) is also the factor by that the budget is increased for the next stage. Because there is a different maximum budget per configuration that makes sense in different scenarios, the user also has to set this as the \\(R\\) parameter. No further parameters are required for Hyperband – the full required budget across all brackets is indirectly given by \\[(\\lfloor \\log_{\\eta}{R} \\rfloor + 1)^2 * R\\] (Li et al. 2016). To give an idea how a full bracket layout might look like for a specific \\(R\\) and \\(\\eta\\), a quick overview is given in the following table. Table 3.1: Hyperband layout for \\(\\eta = 2\\) and \\(R = 8\\), consisting of four brackets with \\(n\\) as the amount of active configurations. stage budget n 1 1 8 2 2 4 3 4 2 4 8 1 stage budget n 1 2 6 2 4 3 3 8 1 stage budget n 1 4 4 2 8 2 stage budget n 1 8 4 Of course, early termination based on a performance criterion may be disadvantageous if it is done too aggressively in certain scenarios. A learner to jumping radically in its estimated performance during the training phase may get the best configurations canceled too early, simply because they do not improve quickly enough compared to others. In other words, it is often unclear beforehand if having an high amount of configurations \\(n\\), that gets aggressively discarded early, is better than having a high budget \\(B\\) per configuration. The arising tradeoff, that has to be made, is called the “\\(n\\) versus \\(B/n\\) problem”. To create a balance between selection based on early training performance versus exploration of training performances in later training stages, \\(\\lfloor \\log_{\\eta}{R} \\rfloor + 1\\) brackets are constructed with an associated set of varyingly sized configurations. Thus, some brackets contain more configurations, with a small initial budget. In these, a lot are discarded after having been trained for only a short amount of time, corresponding to the selective trainer in our horse analogy. Others are constructed with fewer configurations, where discarding only takes place after a significant amount of budget was consumed. The last bracket usually never discards anything, but also starts with only very few configurations – this is equivalent to the trainer explorative of later stages. The former corresponds high \\(n\\), while the latter high \\(B/n\\). Even though different brackets are initialized with a different amount of configurations and different initial budget sizes, each bracket is assigned (approximately) the same budget \\((\\lfloor \\log_{\\eta}{R} \\rfloor + 1) * R\\). The configurations at the start of each bracket are initialized by random, often uniform sampling. Note that currently all configurations are trained completely from the beginning, so no online updates of models from stage to stage is happening. To identify the budget for evaluating Hyperband, the user has to specify explicitly which hyperparameter of the learner influences the budget by extending a single hyperparameter in the ParamSet with an argument (tags = \"budget\"), like in the following snippet: library(paradox) # Hyperparameter subset of XGBoost params = list( ParamInt$new(&quot;nrounds&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 16, tags = &quot;budget&quot;), ParamFct$new(&quot;booster&quot;, levels = c(&quot;gbtree&quot;, &quot;gblinear&quot;, &quot;dart&quot;)) ) Thanks to the broad ecosystem of the mlr3verse a learner does not require a natural budget parameter. A typical case of this would be decision trees. By using subsampling as preprocessing with mlr3pipelines, we can work around a lacking budget parameter. library(mlr3tuning) library(mlr3hyperband) library(mlr3pipelines) set.seed(123) # extend &quot;classif.rpart&quot; with &quot;subsampling&quot; as preprocessing step ll = po(&quot;subsample&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) # extend hyperparameters of &quot;classif.rpart&quot; with subsampling fraction as budget params = list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;classif.rpart.cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1), ParamInt$new(&quot;classif.rpart.minsplit&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 10), ParamDbl$new(&quot;subsample.frac&quot;, lower = 0.1, upper = 1, tags = &quot;budget&quot;) ) We can now plug the new learner with the extended hyperparameter set into a TuningInstanceSingleCrit the same way as usual. Naturally, Hyperband terminates once all of its brackets are evaluated, so a Terminator in the tuning instance acts as an upper bound and should be only set to a low value if one is unsure of how long Hyperband will take to finish under the given settings. inst = TuningInstanceSingleCrit$new( tsk(&quot;iris&quot;), ll, rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;), msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;), ParamSet$new(params), trm(&quot;none&quot;) # hyperband terminates itself ) Now, we initialize a new instance of the mlr3hyperband::TunerHyperband class and start tuning with it. tuner = tnr(&quot;hyperband&quot;, eta = 3) tuner$optimize(inst) ##

classif.ce ## 0.02 If you are familiar with the original paper, you may have wondered how we just used Hyperband with a parameter ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 (Li et al. 2016). The answer is, with the help the internal rescaling of the budget parameter. mlr3hyperband automatically divides the budget parameters boundaries with its lower bound, ending up with a budget range starting again at 1, like it is the case originally. If we want an overview of what bracket layout Hyperband created and how the rescaling in each bracket worked, we can print a compact table to see this information. unique(inst$archive$data()[, .(bracket, bracket_stage, budget_scaled, budget_real, n_configs)]) ## bracket bracket_stage budget_scaled budget_real n_configs ## 1: 2 0 1.111 0.1111 9 ## 2: 2 1 3.333 0.3333 3 ## 3: 2 2 10.000 1.0000 1 ## 4: 1 0 3.333 0.3333 5 ## 5: 1 1 10.000 1.0000 1 ## 6: 0 0 10.000 1.0000 3 In the traditional way, Hyperband uses uniform sampling to receive a configuration sample at the start of each bracket. But it is also possible to define a custom Sampler for each hyperparameter. library(mlr3learners) set.seed(123) params = list( ParamInt$new(&quot;nrounds&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 16, tag = &quot;budget&quot;), ParamDbl$new(&quot;eta&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 1), ParamFct$new(&quot;booster&quot;, levels = c(&quot;gbtree&quot;, &quot;gblinear&quot;, &quot;dart&quot;)) ) inst = TuningInstanceSingleCrit$new( tsk(&quot;iris&quot;), lrn(&quot;classif.xgboost&quot;), rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;), msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;), ParamSet$new(params), trm(&quot;none&quot;) # hyperband terminates itself ) # beta distribution with alpha = 2 and beta = 5 # categorical distribution with custom probabilities sampler = SamplerJointIndep$new(list( Sampler1DRfun$new(params[[2]], function(n) rbeta(n, 2, 5)), Sampler1DCateg$new(params[[3]], prob = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5)) )) Then, the defined sampler has to be given as an argument during instance creation. Afterwards, the usual tuning can proceed. tuner = tnr(&quot;hyperband&quot;, eta = 2, sampler = sampler) tuner$optimize(inst) ## INFO [19:27:34.861] Starting to optimize 3 parameter(s) with &#39;&lt;TunerHyperband&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;TerminatorNone&gt;&#39; ##

The technique of extracting a subset of relevant features is called “feature selection”. The objective of feature selection is to fit the sparse dependent of a model on a subset of available data features in the most suitable manner. Feature selection can enhance the interpretability of the model, speed up the learning process and improve the learner performance. Different approaches exist to identify the relevant features. Two different approaches are emphasized in the literature: one is called Filtering and the other approach is often referred to as feature subset selection or wrapper methods. What are the differences (Guyon and Elisseeff 2003; Chandrashekar and Sahin 2014)? Filtering: An external algorithm computes a rank of the features (e.g. based on the correlation to the response). Then, features are subsetted by a certain criteria, e.g. an absolute number or a percentage of the number of variables. The selected features will then be used to fit a model (with optional hyperparameters selected by tuning). This calculation is usually cheaper than “feature subset selection” in terms of computation time. All filters are connected via package mlr3filters. Wrapper Methods: Here, no ranking of features is done. Instead, an optimization algorithm selects a subset of the features, evaluates the set by calculating the resampled predictive performance, and then proposes a new set of features (or terminates). A simple example is the sequential forward selection. This method is usually computationally very intensive as a lot of models are fitted. Also, strictly speaking, all these models would need to be tuned before the performance is estimated. This would require an additional nested level in a CV setting. After undertaken all of these steps, the final set of selected features is again fitted (with optional hyperparameters selected by tuning). Wrapper methods are implemented in the mlr3fselect package. Embedded Methods: Many learners internally select a subset of the features which they find helpful for prediction. These subsets can usually be queried, as the following example demonstrates: task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) # ensure that the learner selects features stopifnot(&quot;selected_features&quot; %in% learner$properties) # fit a simple classification tree learner = learner$train(task) # extract all features used in the classification tree: learner$selected_features() ## [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; There are also Ensemble filters built upon the idea of stacking single filter methods. These are not yet implemented. 3.4.1 Filters Filter methods assign an importance value to each feature. Based on these values the features can be ranked. Thereafter, we are able to select a feature subset. There is a list of all implemented filter methods in the Appendix. 3.4.2 Calculating filter values Currently, only classification and regression tasks are supported. The first step it to create a new R object using the class of the desired filter method. Each object of class Filter has a .$calculate() method which computes the filter values and ranks them in a descending order. library(&quot;mlr3filters&quot;) filter = FilterJMIM$new() task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) filter$calculate(task) as.data.table(filter) ## feature score ## 1: Petal.Width 1.0000 ## 2: Sepal.Length 0.6667 ## 3: Petal.Length 0.3333 ## 4: Sepal.Width 0.0000 Some filters support changing specific hyperparameters. This is similar to setting hyperparameters of a Learner using .$param_set$values: filter_cor = FilterCorrelation$new() filter_cor$param_set ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper ## 1: use ParamFct NA NA ## 2: method ParamFct NA NA ## levels ## 1: everything,all.obs,complete.obs,na.or.complete,pairwise.complete.obs ## 2: pearson,kendall,spearman ## default value ## 1: everything ## 2: pearson # change parameter &#39;method&#39; filter_cor$param_set$values = list(method = &quot;spearman&quot;) filter_cor$param_set ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper ## 1: use ParamFct NA NA ## 2: method ParamFct NA NA ## levels ## 1: everything,all.obs,complete.obs,na.or.complete,pairwise.complete.obs ## 2: pearson,kendall,spearman ## default value ## 1: everything ## 2: pearson spearman Rather than taking the “long” R6 way to create a filter, there is also a built-in shorthand notation for filter creation: filter = flt(&quot;cmim&quot;) filter ## &lt;FilterCMIM:cmim&gt; ## Task Types: classif, regr ## Task Properties: - ## Packages: praznik ## Feature types: integer, numeric, factor, ordered 3.4.3 Variable Importance Filters All Learner with the property “importance” come with integrated feature selection methods. You can find a list of all learners with this property in the Appendix. For some learners the desired filter method needs to be set during learner creation. For example, learner classif.ranger (in the package mlr3learners) comes with multiple integrated methods. See the help page of ranger::ranger. To use method “impurity”, you need to set the filter method during construction. library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) lrn = lrn(&quot;classif.ranger&quot;, importance = &quot;impurity&quot;) Now you can use the mlr3filters::FilterImportance class for algorithm-embedded methods to filter a Task. library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) filter = flt(&quot;importance&quot;, learner = lrn) filter$calculate(task) head(as.data.table(filter), 3) ## feature score ## 1: Petal.Width 43.935 ## 2: Petal.Length 42.932 ## 3: Sepal.Length 9.937 3.4.4 Ensemble Methods Work in progress. 3.4.5 Wrapper Methods Wrapper feature selection is supported via the mlr3fselect extension package. At the heart of mlr3fselect are the R6 classes: FSelectInstanceSingleCrit, FSelectInstanceMultiCrit: These two classes describe the feature selection problem and store the results. FSelector: This class is the base class for implementations of feature selection algorithms. 3.4.6 The FSelectInstance Classes The following sub-section examines the feature selection on the Pima data set which is used to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. task = tsk(&quot;pima&quot;) print(task) ## &lt;TaskClassif:pima&gt; (768 x 9) ## * Target: diabetes ## * Properties: twoclass ## * Features (8): ## - dbl (8): age, glucose, insulin, mass, pedigree, pregnant, pressure, ## triceps We use the classification tree from rpart. learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) Next, we need to specify how to evaluate the performance of the feature subsets. For this, we need to choose a resampling strategy and a performance measure. hout = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;) measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) Finally, one has to choose the available budget for the feature selection. This is done by selecting one of the available Terminators: Terminate after a given time (TerminatorClockTime) Terminate after a given amount of iterations (TerminatorEvals) Terminate after a specific performance is reached (TerminatorPerfReached) Terminate when feature selection does not improve (TerminatorStagnation) A combination of the above in an ALL or ANY fashion (TerminatorCombo) For this short introduction, we specify a budget of 20 evaluations and then put everything together into a FSelectInstanceSingleCrit: library(&quot;mlr3fselect&quot;) evals20 = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 20) instance = FSelectInstanceSingleCrit$new( task = task, learner = learner, resampling = hout, measure = measure, terminator = evals20 ) instance ## &lt;FSelectInstanceSingleCrit&gt; ## * State: Not optimized ## * Objective: &lt;ObjectiveFSelect:classif.rpart_on_pima&gt; ## * Search Space: ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: age ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 2: glucose ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 3: insulin ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 4: mass ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 5: pedigree ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 6: pregnant ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 7: pressure ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 8: triceps ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## * Terminator: &lt;TerminatorEvals&gt; ## * Terminated: FALSE ## * Archive: ## &lt;ArchiveFSelect&gt; ## Null data.table (0 rows and 0 cols) To start the feature selection, we still need to select an algorithm which are defined via the FSelector class 3.4.7 The FSelector Class The following algorithms are currently implemented in mlr3fselect: Random Search (FSelectorRandomSearch) Exhaustive Search (FSelectorExhaustiveSearch) Sequential Search (FSelectorSequential) Recursive Feature Elimination (FSelectorRFE) Design Points (FSelectorDesignPoints) In this example, we will use a simple random search. fselector = fs(&quot;random_search&quot;) 3.4.8 Triggering the Tuning To start the feature selection, we simply pass the FSelectInstanceSingleCrit to the $optimize() method of the initialized FSelector. The algorithm proceeds as follows The FSelector proposes at least one feature subset and may propose multiple subsets to improve parallelization, which can be controlled via the setting batch_size). For each feature subset, the given Learner is fitted on the Task using the provided Resampling. All evaluations are stored in the archive of the FSelectInstanceSingleCrit. The Terminator is queried if the budget is exhausted. If the budget is not exhausted, restart with 1) until it is. Determine the feature subset with the best observed performance.

This allows e.g. to score the included ResampleResults on a different measure. Now the optimized feature subset can be used to subset the task and fit the model on all observations. task$select(instance$result_feature_set) learner$train(task) The trained model can now be used to make a prediction on external data. Note that predicting on observations present in the task, should be avoided. The model has seen these observations already during feature selection and therefore results would be statistically biased. Hence, the resulting performance measure would be over-optimistic. Instead, to get statistically unbiased performance estimates for the current task, nested resampling is required. 3.4.9 Automating the Feature Selection The AutoFSelector wraps a learner and augments it with an automatic feature selection for a given task. Because the AutoFSelector itself inherits from the Learner base class, it can be used like any other learner. Analogously to the previous subsection, a new classification tree learner is created. This classification tree learner automatically starts a feature selection on the given task using an inner resampling (holdout). We create a terminator which allows 10 evaluations, and and uses a simple random search as feature selection algorithm: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3fselect&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) terminator = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 10) fselector = fs(&quot;random_search&quot;) at = AutoFSelector$new( learner = learner, resampling = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;), measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;), terminator = terminator, fselector = fselector ) at ## &lt;AutoFSelector:classif.rpart.fselector&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: xval=0 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights We can now use the learner like any other learner, calling the $train() and $predict() method. This time however, we pass it to benchmark() to compare the optimized feature subset to the complete feature set. This way, the AutoFSelector will do its resampling for feature selection on the training set of the respective split of the outer resampling. The learner then undertakes predictions using the test set of the outer resampling. This yields unbiased performance measures, as the observations in the test set have not been used during feature selection or fitting of the respective learner. This is called nested resampling. To compare the optimized feature subset with the complete feature set, we can use benchmark(): grid = benchmark_grid( task = tsk(&quot;pima&quot;), learner = list(at, lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)), resampling = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) ) # avoid console output from mlrfselect logger = lgr::get_logger(&quot;bbotk&quot;) logger$set_threshold(&quot;warn&quot;) bmr = benchmark(grid, store_models = TRUE) bmr$aggregate(msrs(c(&quot;classif.ce&quot;, &quot;time_train&quot;))) ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id iters ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; pima classif.rpart.fselector cv 3 ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; pima classif.rpart cv 3 ## classif.ce time_train ## 1: 0.2786 0 ## 2: 0.2396 0 Note that we do not expect any significant differences since we only evaluated a small fraction of the possible feature subsets. References "],["pipelines.html", "4 Pipelines", " 4 Pipelines mlr3pipelines is a dataflow programming toolkit. This chapter focuses on the applicant’s side of the package. A more in-depth and technically oriented vignette can be found in the mlr3pipeline vignette. Machine learning workflows can be written as directed “Graphs”/“Pipelines” that represent data flows between preprocessing, model fitting, and ensemble learning units in an expressive and intuitive language. We will most often use the term “Graph” in this manual but it can interchangeably be used with “pipeline” or “workflow”. Below you can examine an example for such a graph: Single computational steps can be represented as so-called PipeOps, which can then be connected with directed edges in a Graph. The scope of mlr3pipelines is still growing. Currently supported features are: Data manipulation and preprocessing operations, e.g. PCA, feature filtering, imputation Task subsampling for speed and outcome class imbalance handling mlr3 Learner operations for prediction and stacking Ensemble methods and aggregation of predictions Additionally, we implement several meta operators that can be used to construct powerful pipelines: Simultaneous path branching (data going both ways) Alternative path branching (data going one specific way, controlled by hyperparameters) An extensive introduction to creating custom PipeOps (PO’s) can be found in the technical introduction. Using methods from mlr3tuning, it is even possible to simultaneously optimize parameters of multiple processing units. A predecessor to this package is the mlrCPO package, which works with mlr 2.x. Other packages that provide, to varying degree, some preprocessing functionality or machine learning domain specific language, are: the caret package and the related recipes project the dplyr package An example for a Pipeline that can be constructed using mlr3pipelines is depicted below: "],["pipe-pipeops.html", "4.1 The Building Blocks: PipeOps", " 4.1 The Building Blocks: PipeOps The building blocks of mlr3pipelines are PipeOp-objects (PO). They can be constructed directly using PipeOp&lt;NAME&gt;$new(), but the recommended way is to retrieve them from the mlr_pipeops dictionary: library(&quot;mlr3pipelines&quot;) as.data.table(mlr_pipeops) ##

Hyperparameters of POs can be set through the param_vals argument.

It takes either a PipeOp or a Graph on each of its sides and connects all of the outputs of its left-hand side to one of the inputs each of its right-hand side.

The manual way (= hard way) to construct a Graph is to create an empty graph first. Then one fills the empty graph with POs, and connects edges between the POs. Conceptually, this may look like this: POs are identified by their $id. Note that the operations all modify the object in-place and return the object itself. Therefore, multiple modifications can be chained. For this example we use the pca PO defined above and a new PO named “mutate”. The latter creates a new feature from existing variables. Additionally, we use the filter PO again. mutate = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;mutate&quot;) filter = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;filter&quot;, filter = mlr3filters::FilterVariance$new(), param_vals = list(filter.frac = 0.5)) graph = Graph$new()$ add_pipeop(mutate)$ add_pipeop(filter)$ add_edge(&quot;mutate&quot;, &quot;variance&quot;) # add connection mutate -&gt; filter The much quicker way is to use the %&gt;&gt;% operator to chain POs or Graph s.

A GraphLearner encapsulates the whole pipeline (including the preprocessing steps) and can be put into resample() or benchmark() . If you are familiar with the old mlr package, this is the equivalent of all the make*Wrapper() functions. The pipeline being encapsulated (here Graph ) must always produce a Prediction with its $predict() call, so it will probably contain at least one PipeOpLearner . glrn = GraphLearner$new(graph) This learner can be used for model fitting, resampling, benchmarking, and tuning: cv3 = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) resample(task, glrn, cv3) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: iris ## * Learner: mutate.variance.classif.rpart ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations 4.4.1 Setting Hyperparameters Individual POs offer hyperparameters because they contain $param_set slots that can be read and written from $param_set$values (via the paradox package). The parameters get passed down to the Graph, and finally to the GraphLearner . This makes it not only possible to easily change the behavior of a Graph / GraphLearner and try different settings manually, but also to perform tuning using the mlr3tuning package. glrn$param_set$values$variance.filter.frac = 0.25 cv3 = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) resample(task, glrn, cv3) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: iris ## * Learner: mutate.variance.classif.rpart ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations 4.4.2 Tuning If you are unfamiliar with tuning in mlr3, we recommend to take a look at the section about tuning first. Here we define a ParamSet for the “rpart” learner and the “variance” filter which should be optimized during the tuning process. library(&quot;paradox&quot;) ps = ParamSet$new(list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;classif.rpart.cp&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 0.05), ParamDbl$new(&quot;variance.filter.frac&quot;, lower = 0.25, upper = 1) )) After having defined the PerformanceEvaluator, a random search with 10 iterations is created. For the inner resampling, we are simply using holdout (single split into train/test) to keep the runtimes reasonable. library(&quot;mlr3tuning&quot;) instance = TuningInstanceSingleCrit$new( task = task, learner = glrn, resampling = rsmp(&quot;holdout&quot;), measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;), search_space = ps, terminator = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 20) ) tuner = tnr(&quot;random_search&quot;) tuner$optimize(instance) The tuning result can be found in the respective result slots. instance$result_learner_param_vals instance$result_y "],["pipe-nonlinear.html", "4.5 Non-Linear Graphs", " 4.5 Non-Linear Graphs The Graphs seen so far all have a linear structure. Some POs may have multiple input or output channels. These channels make it possible to create non-linear Graphs with alternative paths taken by the data. Possible types are: Branching: Splitting of a node into several paths, e.g. useful when comparing multiple feature-selection methods (pca, filters). Only one path will be executed. Copying: Splitting of a node into several paths, all paths will be executed (sequentially). Parallel execution is not yet supported. Stacking: Single graphs are stacked onto each other, i.e. the output of one Graph is the input for another. In machine learning this means that the prediction of one Graph is used as input for another Graph 4.5.1 Branching &amp; Copying The PipeOpBranch and PipeOpUnbranch POs make it possible to specify multiple alternative paths. Only one path is actually executed, the others are ignored. The active path is determined by a hyperparameter. This concept makes it possible to tune alternative preprocessing paths (or learner models). Below a conceptual visualization of branching: PipeOp(Un)Branch is initialized either with the number of branches, or with a character-vector indicating the names of the branches. If names are given, the “branch-choosing” hyperparameter becomes more readable. In the following, we set three options: Doing nothing (“nop”) Applying a PCA Scaling the data It is important to “unbranch” again after “branching”, so that the outputs are merged into one result objects. In the following we first create the branched graph and then show what happens if the “unbranching” is not applied: graph = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;branch&quot;, c(&quot;nop&quot;, &quot;pca&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;)) %&gt;&gt;% gunion(list( mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;nop&quot;, id = &quot;null1&quot;), mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;), mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;) )) Without “unbranching” one creates the following graph: graph$plot(html = FALSE) Now when “unbranching”, we obtain the following results: (graph %&gt;&gt;% mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;unbranch&quot;, c(&quot;nop&quot;, &quot;pca&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;)))$plot(html = FALSE) The same can be achieved using a shorter notation: # List of pipeops opts = list(po(&quot;nop&quot;, &quot;no_op&quot;), po(&quot;pca&quot;), po(&quot;scale&quot;)) # List of po ids opt_ids = mlr3misc::map_chr(opts, `[[`, &quot;id&quot;) po(&quot;branch&quot;, options = opt_ids) %&gt;&gt;% gunion(opts) %&gt;&gt;% po(&quot;unbranch&quot;, options = opt_ids) ## Graph with 5 PipeOps: ## ID State sccssors prdcssors ## branch &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; no_op,pca,scale ## no_op &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; unbranch branch ## pca &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; unbranch branch ## scale &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; unbranch branch ## unbranch &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; no_op,pca,scale 4.5.2 Model Ensembles We can leverage the different operations presented to connect POs. This allows us to form powerful graphs. Before we go into details, we split the task into train and test indices. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) train.idx = sample(seq_len(task$nrow), 120) test.idx = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train.idx) 4.5.2.1 Bagging We first examine Bagging introduced by (Breiman 1996). The basic idea is to create multiple predictors and then aggregate those to a single, more powerful predictor. “… multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets” (Breiman 1996) Bagging then aggregates a set of predictors by averaging (regression) or majority vote (classification). The idea behind bagging is, that a set of weak, but different predictors can be combined in order to arrive at a single, better predictor. We can achieve this by downsampling our data before training a learner, repeating this e.g. 10 times and then performing a majority vote on the predictions. Graphically, it may be summarized as follows: First, we create a simple pipeline, that uses PipeOpSubsample before a PipeOpLearner is trained: single_pred = PipeOpSubsample$new(param_vals = list(frac = 0.7)) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) We can now copy this operation 10 times using pipeline_greplicate. The pipeline_greplicate allows us to parallelize many copies of an operation by creating a Graph containing n copies of the input Graph. We can also create it using syntactic sugar via ppl(): pred_set = ppl(&quot;greplicate&quot;, single_pred, 10L) Afterwards we need to aggregate the 10 pipelines to form a single model: bagging = pred_set %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpClassifAvg$new(innum = 10L) Now we can plot again to see what happens: bagging$plot(html = FALSE) This pipeline can again be used in conjunction with GraphLearner in order for Bagging to be used like a Learner: baglrn = GraphLearner$new(bagging) baglrn$train(task, train.idx) baglrn$predict(task, test.idx) ## &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 30 observations: ## row_id truth response prob.setosa prob.versicolor prob.virginica ## 6 setosa setosa 1 0.0 0.0 ## 11 setosa setosa 1 0.0 0.0 ## 14 setosa setosa 1 0.0 0.0 ## --- ## 130 virginica versicolor 0 0.6 0.4 ## 140 virginica virginica 0 0.0 1.0 ## 141 virginica virginica 0 0.0 1.0 In conjunction with different Backends, this can be a very powerful tool. In cases when the data does not fully fit in memory, one can obtain a fraction of the data for each learner from a DataBackend and then aggregate predictions over all learners. 4.5.2.2 Stacking Stacking (Wolpert 1992) is another technique that can improve model performance. The basic idea behind stacking is the use of predictions from one model as features for a subsequent model to possibly improve performance. Below an conceptual illustration of stacking: As an example we can train a decision tree and use the predictions from this model in conjunction with the original features in order to train an additional model on top. To limit overfitting, we additionally do not predict on the original predictions of the learner. Instead, we predict on out-of-bag predictions. To do all this, we can use PipeOpLearnerCV . PipeOpLearnerCV performs nested cross-validation on the training data, fitting a model in each fold. Each of the models is then used to predict on the out-of-fold data. As a result, we obtain predictions for every data point in our input data. We first create a “level 0” learner, which is used to extract a lower level prediction. Additionally, we clone() the learner object to obtain a copy of the learner. Subsequently, one sets a custom id for the PipeOp . lrn = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) lrn_0 = PipeOpLearnerCV$new(lrn$clone()) lrn_0$id = &quot;rpart_cv&quot; We use PipeOpNOP in combination with gunion, in order to send the unchanged Task to the next level. There it is combined with the predictions from our decision tree learner. level_0 = gunion(list(lrn_0, PipeOpNOP$new())) Afterwards, we want to concatenate the predictions from PipeOpLearnerCV and the original Task using PipeOpFeatureUnion : combined = level_0 %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(2) Now we can train another learner on top of the combined features: stack = combined %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(lrn$clone()) stack$plot(html = FALSE) stacklrn = GraphLearner$new(stack) stacklrn$train(task, train.idx) stacklrn$predict(task, test.idx) In this vignette, we showed a very simple use-case for stacking. In many real-world applications, stacking is done for multiple levels and on multiple representations of the dataset. On a lower level, different preprocessing methods can be defined in conjunction with several learners. On a higher level, we can then combine those predictions in order to form a very powerful model. 4.5.2.3 Multilevel Stacking In order to showcase the power of mlr3pipelines, we will show a more complicated stacking example. In this case, we train a glmnet and 2 different rpart models (some transform its inputs using PipeOpPCA ) on our task in the “level 0” and concatenate them with the original features (via gunion). The result is then passed on to “level 1”, where we copy the concatenated features 3 times and put this task into an rpart and a glmnet model. Additionally, we keep a version of the “level 0” output (via PipeOpNOP) and pass this on to “level 2”. In “level 2” we simply concatenate all “level 1” outputs and train a final decision tree. In the following examples, use &lt;lrn&gt;$param_set$values$&lt;param_name&gt; = &lt;param_value&gt; to set hyperparameters for the different learner. library(&quot;magrittr&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) # for classif.glmnet rprt = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) glmn = lrn(&quot;classif.glmnet&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) # Create Learner CV Operators lrn_0 = PipeOpLearnerCV$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_cv_1&quot;) lrn_0$param_set$values$maxdepth = 5L lrn_1 = PipeOpPCA$new(id = &quot;pca1&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearnerCV$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_cv_2&quot;) lrn_1$param_set$values$rpart_cv_2.maxdepth = 1L lrn_2 = PipeOpPCA$new(id = &quot;pca2&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearnerCV$new(glmn) # Union them with a PipeOpNULL to keep original features level_0 = gunion(list(lrn_0, lrn_1,lrn_2, PipeOpNOP$new(id = &quot;NOP1&quot;))) # Cbind the output 3 times, train 2 learners but also keep level # 0 predictions level_1 = level_0 %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(4) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpCopy$new(3) %&gt;&gt;% gunion(list( PipeOpLearnerCV$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_cv_l1&quot;), PipeOpLearnerCV$new(glmn, id = &quot;glmnt_cv_l1&quot;), PipeOpNOP$new(id = &quot;NOP_l1&quot;) )) # Cbind predictions, train a final learner level_2 = level_1 %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(3, id = &quot;u2&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_l2&quot;) # Plot the resulting graph level_2$plot(html = FALSE) task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) lrn = GraphLearner$new(level_2) And we can again call .$train and .$predict: lrn$ train(task, train.idx)$ predict(task, test.idx)$ score() ## classif.ce ## 0 References "],["pipe-special-ops.html", "4.6 Special Operators", " 4.6 Special Operators This section introduces some special operators, that might be useful in numerous further applications. 4.6.1 Imputation: PipeOpImpute An often occurring setting is the imputation of missing data. Imputation methods range from relatively simple imputation using either mean, median or histograms to way more involved methods including using machine learning algorithms in order to predict missing values. The following PipeOps, PipeOpImpute: Impute numeric values from a histogram Adds a new level for factors Add a column marking whether a value for a given feature was missing or not (numeric only) We use po(\"featureunion\") to cbind the missing indicator features. pom = PipeOpMissInd$new() pon = PipeOpImputeHist$new(id = &quot;imputer_num&quot;, param_vals = list(affect_columns = is.numeric)) pof = PipeOpImputeOOR$new(id = &quot;imputer_fct&quot;, param_vals = list(affect_columns = is.factor)) imputer = pom %&gt;&gt;% pon %&gt;&gt;% pof A learner can thus be equipped with automatic imputation of missing values by adding an imputation Pipeop. polrn = PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) lrn = GraphLearner$new(graph = imputer %&gt;&gt;% polrn) 4.6.2 Feature Engineering: PipeOpMutate New features can be added or computed from a task using PipeOpMutate . The operator evaluates one or multiple expressions provided in an alist. In this example, we compute some new features on top of the iris task. Then we add them to the data as illustrated below: pom = PipeOpMutate$new() # Define a set of mutations mutations = list( Sepal.Sum = ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, Petal.Sum = ~ Petal.Length + Petal.Width, Sepal.Petal.Ratio = ~ (Sepal.Length / Petal.Length) ) pom$param_set$values$mutation = mutations If outside data is required, we can make use of the env parameter. Moreover, we provide an environment, where expressions are evaluated (env defaults to .GlobalEnv). 4.6.3 Training on data subsets: PipeOpChunk In cases, where data is too big to fit into the machine’s memory, an often-used technique is to split the data into several parts. Subsequently, the parts are trained on each part of the data. After undertaking these steps, we aggregate the models. In this example, we split our data into 4 parts using PipeOpChunk . Additionally, we create 4 PipeOpLearner POS, which are then trained on each split of the data. chks = PipeOpChunk$new(4) lrns = ppl(&quot;greplicate&quot;, PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)), 4) Afterwards we can use PipeOpClassifAvg to aggregate the predictions from the 4 different models into a new one. mjv = PipeOpClassifAvg$new(4) We can now connect the different operators and visualize the full graph: pipeline = chks %&gt;&gt;% lrns %&gt;&gt;% mjv pipeline$plot(html = FALSE) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) train.idx = sample(seq_len(task$nrow), 120) test.idx = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train.idx) pipelrn = GraphLearner$new(pipeline) pipelrn$train(task, train.idx)$ predict(task, train.idx)$ score() ## classif.ce ## 0.025 4.6.4 Feature Selection: PipeOpFilter and PipeOpSelect The package mlr3filters contains many different mlr3filters::Filters that can be used to select features for subsequent learners. This is often required when the data has a large amount of features. A PipeOp for filters is PipeOpFilter: PipeOpFilter$new(mlr3filters::FilterInformationGain$new()) ## PipeOp: &lt;information_gain&gt; (not trained) ## values: &lt;list()&gt; ## Input channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## input [Task,Task] ## Output channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## output [Task,Task] How many features to keep can be set using filter_nfeat, filter_frac and filter_cutoff. Filters can be selected / de-selected by name using PipeOpSelect. "],["in-depth-pipelines.html", "4.7 In-depth look into mlr3pipelines", " 4.7 In-depth look into mlr3pipelines This vignette is an in-depth introduction to mlr3pipelines, the dataflow programming toolkit for machine learning in R using mlr3. It will go through basic concepts and then give a few examples that both show the simplicity as well as the power and versatility of using mlr3pipelines. 4.7.1 What’s the Point Machine learning toolkits often try to abstract away the processes happening inside machine learning algorithms. This makes it easy for the user to switch out one algorithm for another without having to worry about what is happening inside it, what kind of data it is able to operate on etc. The benefit of using mlr3, for example, is that one can create a Learner, a Task, a Resampling etc. and use them for typical machine learning operations. It is trivial to exchange individual components and therefore use, for example, a different Learner in the same experiment for comparison. task = TaskClassif$new(&quot;iris&quot;, as_data_backend(iris), &quot;Species&quot;) lrn = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) rsmp = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;) resample(task, lrn, rsmp) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 1 iterations ## * Task: iris ## * Learner: classif.rpart ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations However, this modularity breaks down as soon as the learning algorithm encompasses more than just model fitting, like data preprocessing, ensembles or other meta models. mlr3pipelines takes modularity one step further than mlr3: it makes it possible to build individual steps within a Learner out of building blocks called PipeOps. 4.7.2 PipeOp: Pipeline Operators The most basic unit of functionality within mlr3pipelines is the PipeOp, short for “pipeline operator”, which represents a trans-formative operation on input (for example a training dataset) leading to output. It can therefore be seen as a generalized notion of a function, with a certain twist: PipeOps behave differently during a “training phase” and a “prediction phase”. The training phase will typically generate a certain model of the data that is saved as internal state. The prediction phase will then operate on the input data depending on the trained model. An example of this behavior is the principal component analysis operation (“PipeOpPCA”): During training, it will transform incoming data by rotating it in a way that leads to uncorrelated features ordered by their contribution to total variance. It will also save the rotation matrix to be used during for new data. This makes it possible to perform “prediction” with single rows of new data, where a row’s scores on each of the principal components (the components of the training data!) is computed. po = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;) po$train(list(task))[[1]]$data() ## Species PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## 1: setosa -2.684 0.31940 -0.02791 -0.002262 ## 2: setosa -2.714 -0.17700 -0.21046 -0.099027 ## 3: setosa -2.889 -0.14495 0.01790 -0.019968 ## 4: setosa -2.745 -0.31830 0.03156 0.075576 ## 5: setosa -2.729 0.32675 0.09008 0.061259 ## --- ## 146: virginica 1.944 0.18753 0.17783 -0.426196 ## 147: virginica 1.527 -0.37532 -0.12190 -0.254367 ## 148: virginica 1.764 0.07886 0.13048 -0.137001 ## 149: virginica 1.901 0.11663 0.72325 -0.044595 ## 150: virginica 1.390 -0.28266 0.36291 0.155039 single_line_task = task$clone()$filter(1) po$predict(list(single_line_task))[[1]]$data() ## Species PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## 1: setosa -2.684 0.3194 -0.02791 -0.002262 po$state ## Standard deviations (1, .., p=4): ## [1] 2.0563 0.4926 0.2797 0.1544 ## ## Rotation (n x k) = (4 x 4): ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## Petal.Length 0.85667 -0.17337 0.07624 0.4798 ## Petal.Width 0.35829 -0.07548 0.54583 -0.7537 ## Sepal.Length 0.36139 0.65659 -0.58203 -0.3155 ## Sepal.Width -0.08452 0.73016 0.59791 0.3197 This shows the most important primitives incorporated in a PipeOp: * $train(), taking a list of input arguments, turning them into a list of outputs, meanwhile saving a state in $state * $predict(), taking a list of input arguments, turning them into a list of outputs, making use of the saved $state * $state, the “model” trained with $train() and utilized during $predict(). Schematically we can represent the PipeOp like so: 4.7.2.1 Why the $state It is important to take a moment and notice the importance of a $state variable and the $train() / $predict() dichotomy in a PipeOp. There are many preprocessing methods, for example scaling of parameters or imputation, that could in theory just be applied to training data and prediction / validation data separately, or they could be applied to a task before resampling is performed. This would, however, be fallacious: The preprocessing of each instance of prediction data should not depend on the remaining prediction dataset. A prediction on a single instance of new data should give the same result as prediction performed on a whole dataset. If preprocessing is performed on a task before resampling is done, information about the test set can leak into the training set. Resampling should evaluate the generalization performance of the entire machine learning method, therefore the behavior of this entire method must only depend only on the content of the training split during resampling. 4.7.2.2 Where to Get PipeOps Each PipeOp is an instance of an “R6” class, many of which are provided by the mlr3pipelines package itself. They can be constructed explicitly (“PipeOpPCA$new()”) or retrieved from the mlr_pipelines collection: mlr_pipeops$get(\"pca\"). The entire list of available PipeOps, and some meta-information, can be retrieved using as.data.table(): as.data.table(mlr_pipeops)[, c(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;input.num&quot;, &quot;output.num&quot;)] ## key input.num output.num ## 1: boxcox 1 1 ## 2: branch 1 NA ## 3: chunk 1 NA ## 4: classbalancing 1 1 ## 5: classifavg NA 1 ## 6: classweights 1 1 ## 7: colapply 1 1 ## 8: collapsefactors 1 1 ## 9: colroles 1 1 ## 10: copy 1 NA ## 11: datefeatures 1 1 ## 12: encode 1 1 ## 13: encodeimpact 1 1 ## 14: encodelmer 1 1 ## 15: featureunion NA 1 ## 16: filter 1 1 ## 17: fixfactors 1 1 ## 18: histbin 1 1 ## 19: ica 1 1 ## 20: imputeconstant 1 1 ## 21: imputehist 1 1 ## 22: imputelearner 1 1 ## 23: imputemean 1 1 ## 24: imputemedian 1 1 ## 25: imputemode 1 1 ## 26: imputeoor 1 1 ## 27: imputesample 1 1 ## 28: kernelpca 1 1 ## 29: learner 1 1 ## 30: learner_cv 1 1 ## 31: missind 1 1 ## 32: modelmatrix 1 1 ## 33: multiplicityexply 1 NA ## 34: multiplicityimply NA 1 ## 35: mutate 1 1 ## 36: nmf 1 1 ## 37: nop 1 1 ## 38: ovrsplit 1 1 ## 39: ovrunite 1 1 ## 40: pca 1 1 ## 41: proxy NA 1 ## 42: quantilebin 1 1 ## 43: randomprojection 1 1 ## 44: randomresponse 1 1 ## 45: regravg NA 1 ## 46: removeconstants 1 1 ## 47: renamecolumns 1 1 ## 48: replicate 1 1 ## 49: scale 1 1 ## 50: scalemaxabs 1 1 ## 51: scalerange 1 1 ## 52: select 1 1 ## 53: smote 1 1 ## 54: spatialsign 1 1 ## 55: subsample 1 1 ## 56: targetinvert 2 1 ## 57: targetmutate 1 2 ## 58: targettrafoscalerange 1 2 ## 59: textvectorizer 1 1 ## 60: threshold 1 1 ## 61: tunethreshold 1 1 ## 62: unbranch NA 1 ## 63: vtreat 1 1 ## 64: yeojohnson 1 1 ## key input.num output.num When retrieving PipeOps from the mlr_pipeops dictionary, it is also possible to give additional constructor arguments, such as an id or parameter values. mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;, param_vals = list(rank. = 3)) ## PipeOp: &lt;pca&gt; (not trained) ## values: &lt;rank.=3&gt; ## Input channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## input [Task,Task] ## Output channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## output [Task,Task] 4.7.3 PipeOp Channels 4.7.3.1 Input Channels Just like functions, PipeOps can take multiple inputs. These multiple inputs are always given as elements in the input list. For example, there is a PipeOpFeatureUnion that combines multiple tasks with different features and “cbind()s” them together, creating one combined task. When two halves of the iris task are given, for example, it recreates the original task: iris_first_half = task$clone()$select(c(&quot;Petal.Length&quot;, &quot;Petal.Width&quot;)) iris_second_half = task$clone()$select(c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;)) pofu = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;featureunion&quot;, innum = 2) pofu$train(list(iris_first_half, iris_second_half))[[1]]$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 ## --- ## 146: virginica 5.2 2.3 6.7 3.0 ## 147: virginica 5.0 1.9 6.3 2.5 ## 148: virginica 5.2 2.0 6.5 3.0 ## 149: virginica 5.4 2.3 6.2 3.4 ## 150: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 Because PipeOpFeatureUnion effectively takes two input arguments here, we can say it has two input channels. An input channel also carries information about the type of input that is acceptable. The input channels of the pofu object constructed above, for example, each accept a Task during training and prediction. This information can be queried from the $input slot: pofu$input ## name train predict ## 1: input1 Task Task ## 2: input2 Task Task Other PipeOps may have channels that take different types during different phases. The backuplearner PipeOp, for example, takes a NULL and a Task during training, and a Prediction and a Task during prediction: ## TODO this is an important case to handle here, do not delete unless there is a better example. ## mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;backuplearner&quot;)$input 4.7.3.2 Output Channels Unlike the typical notion of a function, PipeOps can also have multiple output channels. $train() and $predict() always return a list, so certain PipeOps may return lists with more than one element. Similar to input channels, the information about the number and type of outputs given by a PipeOp is available in the $output slot. The chunk PipeOp, for example, chunks a given Task into subsets and consequently returns multiple Task objects, both during training and prediction. The number of output channels must be given during construction through the outnum argument. mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;chunk&quot;, outnum = 3)$output ## name train predict ## 1: output1 Task Task ## 2: output2 Task Task ## 3: output3 Task Task Note that the number of output channels during training and prediction is the same. A schema of a PipeOp with two output channels: 4.7.3.3 Channel Configuration Most PipeOps have only one input channel (so they take a list with a single element), but there are a few with more than one; In many cases, the number of input or output channels is determined during construction, e.g. through the innum / outnum arguments. The input.num and output.num columns of the mlr_pipeops-table above show the default number of channels, and NA if the number depends on a construction argument. The default printer of a PipeOp gives information about channel names and types: ## mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;backuplearner&quot;) 4.7.4 Graph: Networks of PipeOps 4.7.4.1 Basics What is the advantage of this tedious way of declaring input and output channels and handling in/output through lists? Because each PipeOp has a known number of input and output channels that always produce or accept data of a known type, it is possible to network them together in Graphs. A Graph is a collection of PipeOps with “edges” that mandate that data should be flowing along them. Edges always pass between PipeOp channels, so it is not only possible to explicitly prescribe which position of an input or output list an edge refers to, it makes it possible to make different components of a PipeOp’s output flow to multiple different other PipeOps, as well as to have a PipeOp gather its input from multiple other PipeOps. A schema of a simple graph of PipeOps: A Graph is empty when first created, and PipeOps can be added using the $add_pipeop() method. The $add_edge() method is used to create connections between them. While the printer of a Graph gives some information about its layout, the most intuitive way of visualizing it is using the $plot() function. gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;)) gr$add_pipeop(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;subsample&quot;, param_vals = list(frac = 0.1))) gr$add_edge(&quot;scale&quot;, &quot;subsample&quot;) print(gr) ## Graph with 2 PipeOps: ## ID State sccssors prdcssors ## scale &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; subsample ## subsample &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; scale gr$plot(html = FALSE) A Graph itself has a $train() and a $predict() method that accept some data and propagate this data through the network of PipeOps. The return value corresponds to the output of the PipeOp output channels that are not connected to other PipeOps. gr$train(task)[[1]]$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3110521 -0.8977 1.0156 ## 2: setosa -1.3924 -1.3110521 -0.4146 1.0156 ## 3: setosa -1.2791 -1.3110521 -0.8977 0.7862 ## 4: versicolor 0.5336 0.2632600 1.3968 0.3273 ## 5: versicolor 0.4770 0.3944526 0.7930 -0.5904 ## 6: versicolor 0.4203 0.3944526 0.4307 -1.9670 ## 7: versicolor 0.5336 0.0008746 0.3100 -0.5904 ## 8: versicolor 0.3070 0.1320673 0.6722 -0.3610 ## 9: versicolor 0.2504 0.1320673 -0.2939 -0.8198 ## 10: versicolor -0.4294 -0.1303181 -0.8977 -1.2787 ## 11: versicolor 0.1937 0.1320673 -0.1731 -0.5904 ## 12: virginica 1.2134 1.1816087 1.5176 -0.1315 ## 13: virginica 0.9868 1.1816087 1.1553 -0.1315 ## 14: virginica 1.6666 1.3128014 2.2422 1.7039 ## 15: virginica 1.3267 1.4439941 2.2422 -0.1315 gr$predict(single_line_task)[[1]]$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa -1.336 -1.311 -0.8977 1.016 The collection of PipeOps inside a Graph can be accessed through the $pipeops slot. The set of edges in the Graph can be inspected through the $edges slot. It is possible to modify individual PipeOps and edges in a Graph through these slots, but this is not recommended because no error checking is performed and it may put the Graph in an unsupported state. 4.7.4.2 Networks The example above showed a linear preprocessing pipeline, but it is in fact possible to build true “graphs” of operations, as long as no loops are introduced1. PipeOps with multiple output channels can feed their data to multiple different subsequent PipeOps, and PipeOps with multiple input channels can take results from different PipeOps. When a PipeOp has more than one input / output channel, then the Graph’s $add_edge() method needs an additional argument that indicates which channel to connect to. This argument can be given in the form of an integer, or as the name of the channel. The following constructs a Graph that copies the input and gives one copy each to a “scale” and a “pca” PipeOp. The resulting columns of each operation are put next to each other by “featureunion”. gr = Graph$new()$ add_pipeop(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;copy&quot;, outnum = 2))$ add_pipeop(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;))$ add_pipeop(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;))$ add_pipeop(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;featureunion&quot;, innum = 2)) gr$ add_edge(&quot;copy&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;, src_channel = 1)$ # designating channel by index add_edge(&quot;copy&quot;, &quot;pca&quot;, src_channel = &quot;output2&quot;)$ # designating channel by name add_edge(&quot;scale&quot;, &quot;featureunion&quot;, dst_channel = 1)$ add_edge(&quot;pca&quot;, &quot;featureunion&quot;, dst_channel = 2) gr$plot(html = FALSE) gr$train(iris_first_half)[[1]]$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width PC1 PC2 ## 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -2.561 -0.006922 ## 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -2.561 -0.006922 ## 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -2.653 0.031850 ## 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -2.469 -0.045694 ## 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -2.561 -0.006922 ## --- ## 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.756 0.455479 ## 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 1.417 0.164312 ## 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 1.640 0.178946 ## 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 1.940 0.377936 ## 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 1.470 0.033362 4.7.4.3 Syntactic Sugar Although it is possible to create intricate Graphs with edges going all over the place (as long as no loops are introduced), there is usually a clear direction of flow between “layers” in the Graph. It is therefore convenient to build up a Graph from layers, which can be done using the %&gt;&gt;% (“double-arrow”) operator. It takes either a PipeOp or a Graph on each of its sides and connects all of the outputs of its left-hand side to one of the inputs each of its right-hand side–the number of inputs therefore must match the number of outputs. Together with the gunion() operation, which takes PipeOps or Graphs and arranges them next to each other akin to a (disjoint) graph union, the above network can more easily be constructed as follows: gr = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;copy&quot;, outnum = 2) %&gt;&gt;% gunion(list(mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;), mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;))) %&gt;&gt;% mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;featureunion&quot;, innum = 2) gr$plot(html = FALSE) 4.7.4.4 PipeOp IDs and ID Name Clashes PipeOps within a graph are addressed by their $id-slot. It is therefore necessary for all PipeOps within a Graph to have a unique $id. The $id can be set during or after construction, but it should not directly be changed after a PipeOp was inserted in a Graph. At that point, the $set_names()-method can be used to change PipeOp ids. po1 = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;) po2 = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;) po1 %&gt;&gt;% po2 ## name clash ## Error in gunion(list(g1, g2)): Assertion on &#39;ids of pipe operators&#39; failed: Must have unique names, but element 2 is duplicated. po2$id = &quot;scale2&quot; gr = po1 %&gt;&gt;% po2 gr ## Graph with 2 PipeOps: ## ID State sccssors prdcssors ## scale &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; scale2 ## scale2 &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; scale ## Alternative ways of getting new ids: mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;, id = &quot;scale2&quot;) ## PipeOp: &lt;scale2&gt; (not trained) ## values: &lt;robust=FALSE&gt; ## Input channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## input [Task,Task] ## Output channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## output [Task,Task] PipeOpScale$new(id = &quot;scale2&quot;) ## PipeOp: &lt;scale2&gt; (not trained) ## values: &lt;robust=FALSE&gt; ## Input channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## input [Task,Task] ## Output channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: ## output [Task,Task] ## sometimes names of PipeOps within a Graph need to be changed gr2 = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;scale&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;) gr %&gt;&gt;% gr2 ## Error in gunion(list(g1, g2)): Assertion on &#39;ids of pipe operators&#39; failed: Must have unique names, but element 3 is duplicated. gr2$set_names(&quot;scale&quot;, &quot;scale3&quot;) gr %&gt;&gt;% gr2 ## Graph with 4 PipeOps: ## ID State sccssors prdcssors ## scale &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; scale2 ## scale2 &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; scale3 scale ## scale3 &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; pca scale2 ## pca &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; scale3 4.7.5 Learners in Graphs, Graphs in Learners The true power of mlr3pipelines derives from the fact that it can be integrated seamlessly with mlr3. Two components are mainly responsible for this: PipeOpLearner, a PipeOp that encapsulates a mlr3 Learner and creates a PredictionData object in its $predict() phase GraphLearner, a mlr3 Learner that can be used in place of any other mlr3 Learner, but which does prediction using a Graph given to it Note that these are dual to each other: One takes a Learner and produces a PipeOp (and by extension a Graph); the other takes a Graph and produces a Learner. 4.7.5.1 PipeOpLearner The PipeOpLearner is constructed using a mlr3 Learner and will use it to create PredictionData in the $predict() phase. The output during $train() is NULL. It can be used after a preprocessing pipeline, and it is even possible to perform operations on the PredictionData, for example by averaging multiple predictions or by using the “PipeOpBackupLearner” operator to impute predictions that a given model failed to create. The following is a very simple Graph that performs training and prediction on data after performing principal component analysis. gr = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;learner&quot;, mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) gr$train(task) ## $classif.rpart.output ## NULL gr$predict(task) ## $classif.rpart.output ## &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 150 observations: ## row_id truth response ## 1 setosa setosa ## 2 setosa setosa ## 3 setosa setosa ## --- ## 148 virginica virginica ## 149 virginica virginica ## 150 virginica virginica 4.7.5.2 GraphLearner Although a Graph has $train() and $predict() functions, it can not be used directly in places where mlr3 Learners can be used like resampling or benchmarks. For this, it needs to be wrapped in a GraphLearner object, which is a thin wrapper that enables this functionality. The resulting Learner is extremely versatile, because every part of it can be modified, replaced, parameterized and optimized over. Resampling the graph above can be done the same way that resampling of the Learner was performed in the introductory example. lrngrph = GraphLearner$new(gr) resample(task, lrngrph, rsmp) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 1 iterations ## * Task: iris ## * Learner: pca.classif.rpart ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations 4.7.6 Hyperparameters mlr3pipelines relies on the paradox package to provide parameters that can modify each PipeOp’s behavior. paradox parameters provide information about the parameters that can be changed, as well as their types and ranges. They provide a unified interface for benchmarks and parameter optimization (“tuning”). For a deep dive into paradox, see the mlr3book. The ParamSet, representing the space of possible parameter configurations of a PipeOp, can be inspected by accessing the $param_set slot of a PipeOp or a Graph. op_pca = mlr_pipeops$get(&quot;pca&quot;) op_pca$param_set ## &lt;ParamSet:pca&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: center ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE TRUE ## 2: scale.

Parallelization At first, some details about Parallelization and the usage of the future are given. Parallelization refers to the process of running multiple jobs simultaneously. This process is employed to minimize the necessary computing power. Algorithms consist of both sequential (non-parallelizable) and parallelizable parts. Therefore, parallelization does not always alter performance in a positive substantial manner. Summed up, this sub-chapter illustrates how and when to use parallelization in mlr3. Database Backends The section Database Backends describes how to work with database backends that mlr3 supports. Database backends can be helpful for large data processing which does not fit in memory or is stored natively in a database (e.g. SQLite). Specifically when working with large data sets, or when undertaking numerous tasks simultaneously, it can be advantageous to interface out-of-memory data. The section provides an illustration of how to implement Database Backends using of NYC flight data. Parameters In the section Parameters instructions are given on how to: define parameter sets for learners undertake parameter sampling apply parameter transformations For illustrative purposes, this sub-chapter uses the paradox package, the successor of ParamHelpers. Logging and Verbosity The sub-chapter on Logging and Verbosity shows how to change the most important settings related to logging. In mlr3 we use the lgr package. Transition Guide Lastly, we provide a Transition Guide for users of the old mlr who want to switch to mlr3. "],["parallelization.html", "5.1 Parallelization", " 5.1 Parallelization Parallelization refers to the process of running multiple jobs in parallel, simultaneously. This process allows for significant savings in computing power. mlr3 uses the future backends for parallelization. Make sure you have installed the required packages future and future.apply: mlr3 is capable of parallelizing a variety of different scenarios. One of the most used cases is to parallelize the Resampling iterations. See Section Resampling for a detailed introduction to resampling. In the following section, we will use the spam task and a simple classification tree (\"classif.rpart\") to showcase parallelization. We use the future package to parallelize the resampling by selecting a backend via the function future::plan(). We use the future::multiprocess backend here which uses forks (c.f. parallel::mcparallel()) on UNIX based systems and a socket cluster on Windows or if running in RStudio: future::plan(&quot;multiprocess&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;spam&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) resampling = rsmp(&quot;subsampling&quot;) time = Sys.time() resample(task, learner, resampling) Sys.time() - time By default all CPUs of your machine are used unless you specify argument workers in future::plan(). On most systems you should see a decrease in the reported elapsed time. On some systems (e.g. Windows), the overhead for parallelization is quite large though. Therefore, it is advised to only enable parallelization for resamplings where each iteration runs at least 10 seconds. Choosing the parallelization level If you are transitioning from mlr, you might be used to selecting different parallelization levels, e.g. for resampling, benchmarking or tuning. In mlr3 this is no longer required. All kind of events are rolled out on the same level. Therefore, there is no need to decide whether you want to parallelize the tuning OR the resampling. In mlr3 this is no longer required. All kind of events are rolled out on the same level - there is no need to decide whether you want to parallelize the tuning OR the resampling. Just lean back and let the machine do the work :-) 5.1.1 Nested Resampling Parallelization Nested resampling results in two nested resampling loops. We can choose different parallelization backends for the inner and outer resampling loop, respectively. We just have to pass a list of future backends: # Runs the outer loop in parallel and the inner loop sequentially future::plan(list(&quot;multisession&quot;, &quot;sequential&quot;)) # Runs the outer loop sequentially and the inner loop in parallel future::plan(list(&quot;sequential&quot;, &quot;multisession&quot;)) While nesting real parallelization backends is often unintended and causes unnecessary overhead, it is useful in some distributed computing setups. It can be achieved with future by forcing a fixed number of workers for each loop: # Runs both loops in parallel future::plan(list(future::tweak(&quot;multisession&quot;, workers = 2), future::tweak(&quot;multisession&quot;, workers = 4))) This example would run on 8 cores (= 2 * 4) on the local machine. The vignette of the future package gives more insight into nested parallelization. "],["error-handling.html", "5.2 Error Handling", " 5.2 Error Handling To demonstrate how to properly deal with misbehaving learners, mlr3 ships with the learner classif.debug: task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) print(learner) ## &lt;LearnerClassifDebug:classif.debug&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: list() ## * Packages: - ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered ## * Properties: missings, multiclass, twoclass This learner comes with special hyperparameters that let us control what conditions should be signaled (message, warning, error, segfault) with what probability during which stage the conditions should be signaled (train or predict) the ratio of predictions being NA (predict_missing) learner$param_set ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: message_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 2: message_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 3: warning_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 4: warning_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 5: error_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 6: error_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 7: segfault_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 8: segfault_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 9: predict_missing ParamDbl 0 1 0 ## 10: save_tasks ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE FALSE ## 11: x ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; With the learner’s default settings, the learner will do nothing special: The learner learns a random label and creates constant predictions. task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner$train(task)$predict(task)$confusion ## truth ## response setosa versicolor virginica ## setosa 0 0 0 ## versicolor 50 50 50 ## virginica 0 0 0 We now set a hyperparameter to let the debug learner signal an error during the train step. By default,mlr3 does not catch conditions such as warnings or errors raised by third-party code like learners: learner$param_set$values = list(error_train = 1) learner$train(tsk(&quot;iris&quot;)) ## Error in .__LearnerClassifDebug__.train(self = self, private = private, : Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() If this would be a regular learner, we could now start debugging with traceback() (or create a MRE to file a bug report). However, machine learning algorithms raising errors is not uncommon as algorithms typically cannot process all possible data. Thus, we need a mechanism to capture all signaled conditions such as messages, warnings and errors so that we can analyze them post-hoc, and a statistically sound way to proceed the calculation and be able to aggregate over partial results. These two mechanisms are explained in the following subsections. 5.2.1 Encapsulation With encapsulation, exceptions do not stop the program flow and all output is logged to the learner (instead of printed to the console). Each Learner has a field encapsulate to control how the train or predict steps are executed. One way to encapsulate the execution is provided by the package evaluate (see encapsulate() for more details): task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) learner$param_set$values = list(warning_train = 1, error_train = 1) learner$encapsulate = c(train = &quot;evaluate&quot;, predict = &quot;evaluate&quot;) learner$train(task) After training the learner, one can access the recorded log via the fields log, warnings and errors: learner$log ## stage class msg ## 1: train warning Warning from classif.debug-&gt;train() ## 2: train error Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() learner$warnings ## [1] &quot;Warning from classif.debug-&gt;train()&quot; learner$errors ## [1] &quot;Error from classif.debug-&gt;train()&quot; Another method for encapsulation is implemented in the callr package. callr spawns a new R process to execute the respective step, and thus even guards the current session from segfaults. On the downside, starting new processes comes with a computational overhead. learner$encapsulate = c(train = &quot;callr&quot;, predict = &quot;callr&quot;) learner$param_set$values = list(segfault_train = 1) learner$train(task = task) learner$errors ## [1] &quot;callr process exited with status -11&quot; Without a model, it is not possible to get predictions though: learner$predict(task) ## Error: Cannot predict, Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; has not been trained yet To handle the missing predictions in a graceful way during resample() or benchmark(), fallback learners are introduced next. 5.2.2 Fallback learners Fallback learners have the purpose to allow scoring results in cases where a Learner is misbehaving in some sense. Some typical examples include: The learner fails to fit a model during training, e.g., if some convergence criterion is not met or the learner ran out of memory. The learner fails to predict for some or all observations. A typical case is e.g. new factor levels in the test data. We first handle the most common case that a learner completely breaks while fitting a model or while predicting on new data. If the learner fails in either of these two steps, we rely on a second learner to generate predictions: the fallback learner. In the next example, in addition to the debug learner, we attach a simple featureless learner to the debug learner. So whenever the debug learner fails (which is every time with the given parametrization) and encapsulation in enabled, mlr3 falls back to the predictions of the featureless learner internally: task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) learner$param_set$values = list(error_train = 1) learner$encapsulate = c(train = &quot;evaluate&quot;) learner$fallback = lrn(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;) learner$train(task) learner ## &lt;LearnerClassifDebug:classif.debug&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: error_train=1 ## * Packages: - ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered ## * Properties: missings, multiclass, twoclass ## * Errors: Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() Note that the log contains the captured error (which is also included in the print output), and although we don’t have a model, we can still get predictions: learner$model ## NULL prediction = learner$predict(task) prediction$score() ## classif.ce ## 0.6667 While the fallback learner is of limited use for this stepwise train-predict procedure, it is invaluable for larger benchmark studies where only few resampling iterations are failing. Here, we need to replace the missing scores with a number in order to aggregate over all resampling iterations. And imputing a number which is equivalent to guessing labels often seems to be the right amount of penalization. In the following snippet we compare the previously created debug learner with a simple classification tree. We re-parametrize the debug learner to fail in roughly 30% of the resampling iterations during the training step: learner$param_set$values = list(error_train = 0.3) bmr = benchmark(benchmark_grid(tsk(&quot;iris&quot;), list(learner, lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)), rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;))) aggr = bmr$aggregate(conditions = TRUE) aggr ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id iters warnings ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; iris classif.debug cv 10 0 ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; iris classif.rpart cv 10 0 ## errors classif.ce ## 1: 2 0.67333 ## 2: 0 0.07333 To further investigate the errors, we can extract the ResampleResult: rr = aggr[learner_id == &quot;classif.debug&quot;]$resample_result[[1L]] rr$errors ## iteration msg ## 1: 2 Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() ## 2: 8 Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() A similar yet different problem emerges when a learner predicts only a subset of the observations in the test set (and predicts NA for others). Handling such predictions in a statistically sound way is not straight-forward and a common source for over-optimism when reporting results. Imagine that our goal is to benchmark two algorithms using a 10-fold cross validation on some binary classification task: Algorithm A is a ordinary logistic regression. Algorithm B is also a ordinary logistic regression, but with a twist: If the logistic regression is rather certain about the predicted label (&gt; 90% probability), it returns the label and a missing value otherwise. When comparing the performance of these two algorithms, it is obviously not fair to average over all predictions of algorithm A while only average over the “easy-to-predict” observations for algorithm B. By doing so, algorithm B would easily outperform algorithm A, but you have not factored in that you can not generate predictions for many observations. On the other hand, it is also not feasible to exclude all observations from the test set of a benchmark study where at least one algorithm failed to predict a label. Instead, we proceed by imputing all missing predictions with something naive, e.g., by predicting the majority class with a featureless learner. And as the majority class may depend on the resampling split (or we opt for some other arbitrary baseline learner), it is best to just train a second learner on the same resampling split. Long story short, if a fallback learner is involved, missing predictions of the base learner will be automatically replaced with predictions from the fallback learner. This is illustrated in the following example: task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) # this hyperparameter sets the ratio of missing predictions learner$param_set$values = list(predict_missing = 0.5) # without fallback p = learner$train(task)$predict(task) table(p$response, useNA = &quot;always&quot;) ## ## setosa versicolor virginica &lt;NA&gt; ## 0 0 75 75 # with fallback learner$fallback = lrn(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;) p = learner$train(task)$predict(task) table(p$response, useNA = &quot;always&quot;) ## ## setosa versicolor virginica &lt;NA&gt; ## 0 150 0 0 Summed up, by combining encapsulation and fallback learners, it is possible to benchmark even quite unreliable or instable learning algorithms in a convenient way. "],["backends.html", "5.3 Database Backends", " 5.3 Database Backends In mlr3, Tasks store their data in an abstract data format, the DataBackend. The default backend uses data.table via the DataBackendDataTable as an in-memory data base. For larger data, or when working with many tasks in parallel, it can be advantageous to interface an out-of-memory data. We use the excellent R package dbplyr which extends dplyr to work on many popular data bases like MariaDB, PostgreSQL or SQLite. 5.3.1 Use Case: NYC Flights To generate a halfway realistic scenario, we use the NYC flights data set from package nycflights13: # load data requireNamespace(&quot;DBI&quot;) ## Loading required namespace: DBI requireNamespace(&quot;RSQLite&quot;) ## Loading required namespace: RSQLite requireNamespace(&quot;nycflights13&quot;) ## Loading required namespace: nycflights13 data(&quot;flights&quot;, package = &quot;nycflights13&quot;) str(flights) ## tibble [336,776 × 19] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ year : int [1:336776] 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 ... ## $ month : int [1:336776] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ day : int [1:336776] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ dep_time : int [1:336776] 517 533 542 544 554 554 555 557 557 558 ... ## $ sched_dep_time: int [1:336776] 515 529 540 545 600 558 600 600 600 600 ... ## $ dep_delay : num [1:336776] 2 4 2 -1 -6 -4 -5 -3 -3 -2 ... ## $ arr_time : int [1:336776] 830 850 923 1004 812 740 913 709 838 753 ... ## $ sched_arr_time: int [1:336776] 819 830 850 1022 837 728 854 723 846 745 ... ## $ arr_delay : num [1:336776] 11 20 33 -18 -25 12 19 -14 -8 8 ... ## $ carrier : chr [1:336776] &quot;UA&quot;

A parameter space is often useful when describing: A set of sensible input values for an R function The set of possible values that slots of a configuration object can take The search space of an optimization process The tools provided by paradox therefore relate to: Parameter checking: Verifying that a set of parameters satisfies the conditions of a parameter space Parameter sampling: Generating parameter values that lie in the parameter space for systematic exploration of program behavior depending on these parameters paradox is, by nature, an auxiliary package that derives its usefulness from other packages that make use of it. It is heavily utilized in other mlr-org packages such as mlr3, mlr3pipelines, and mlr3tuning. 5.4.1 Reference Based Objects paradox is the spiritual successor to the ParamHelpers package and was written from scratch using the R6 class system. The most important consequence of this is that all objects created in paradox are “reference-based”, unlike most other objects in R. When a change is made to a ParamSet object, for example by adding a parameter using the $add() function, all variables that point to this ParamSet will contain the changed object. To create an independent copy of a ParamSet, the $clone() method needs to be used: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) ps = ParamSet$new() ps2 = ps ps3 = ps$clone(deep = TRUE) print(ps) # the same for ps2 and ps3 ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## Empty. ps$add(ParamLgl$new(&quot;a&quot;)) print(ps) # ps was changed ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: a ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; print(ps2) # contains the same reference as ps ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: a ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; print(ps3) # is a &quot;clone&quot; of the old (empty) ps ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## Empty. 5.4.2 Defining a Parameter Space 5.4.2.1 Single Parameters The basic building block for describing parameter spaces is the Param class. It represents a single parameter, which usually can take a single atomic value. Consider, for example, trying to configure the rpart package’s rpart.control object. It has various components (minsplit, cp, …) that all take a single value, and that would all be represented by a different instance of a Param object. The Param class has various sub-classes that represent different value types: ParamInt: Integer numbers ParamDbl: Real numbers ParamFct: String values from a set of possible values, similar to R factors ParamLgl: Truth values (TRUE / FALSE), as logicals in R ParamUty: Parameter that can take any value A particular instance of a parameter is created by calling the attached $new() function: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) parA = ParamLgl$new(id = &quot;A&quot;) parB = ParamInt$new(id = &quot;B&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 10, tags = c(&quot;tag1&quot;, &quot;tag2&quot;)) parC = ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;C&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 4, special_vals = list(NULL)) parD = ParamFct$new(id = &quot;D&quot;, levels = c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), default = &quot;y&quot;) parE = ParamUty$new(id = &quot;E&quot;, custom_check = function(x) checkmate::checkFunction(x)) Every parameter must have: id - A name for the parameter within the parameter set default - A default value special_vals - A list of values that are accepted even if they do not conform to the type tags - Tags that can be used to organize parameters The numeric (Int and Dbl) parameters furthermore allow for specification of a lower and upper bound. Meanwhile, the Fct parameter must be given a vector of levels that define the possible states its parameter can take. The Uty parameter can also have a custom_check function that must return TRUE when a value is acceptable and may return a character(1) error description otherwise. The example above defines parE as a parameter that only accepts functions. All values which are given to the constructor are then accessible from the object for inspection using $. Although all these values can be changed for a parameter after construction, this can be a bad idea and should be avoided when possible. Instead, a new parameter should be constructed. Besides the possible values that can be given to a constructor, there are also the $class, $nlevels, $is_bounded, $has_default, $storage_type, $is_number and $is_categ slots that give information about a parameter. A list of all slots can be found in ?Param. parB$lower ## [1] 0 parA$levels ## [1] TRUE FALSE parE$class ## [1] &quot;ParamUty&quot; It is also possible to get all information of a Param as data.table by calling as.data.table. as.data.table(parA) ## id class lower upper levels nlevels is_bounded special_vals default storage_type tags ## 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE 2 TRUE &lt;list[0]&gt; &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; logical 5.4.2.1.1 Type / Range Checking A Param object offers the possibility to check whether a value satisfies its condition, i.e. is of the right type, and also falls within the range of allowed values, using the $test(), $check(), and $assert() functions. test() should be used within conditional checks and returns TRUE or FALSE, while check() returns an error description when a value does not conform to the parameter (and thus plays well with the checkmate::assert() function). assert() will throw an error whenever a value does not fit. parA$test(FALSE) ## [1] TRUE parA$test(&quot;FALSE&quot;) ## [1] FALSE parA$check(&quot;FALSE&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Must be of type &#39;logical flag&#39;, not &#39;character&#39;&quot; Instead of testing single parameters, it is often more convenient to check a whole set of parameters using a ParamSet. 5.4.2.2 Parameter Sets The ordered collection of parameters is handled in a ParamSet2. It is initialized using the $new() function and optionally takes a list of Params as argument. Parameters can also be added to the constructed ParamSet using the $add() function. It is even possible to add whole ParamSets to other ParamSets. ps = ParamSet$new(list(parA, parB)) ps$add(parC) ps$add(ParamSet$new(list(parD, parE))) print(ps) ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 2: B ParamInt 0 10 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 4: D ParamFct NA NA x,y,z y ## 5: E ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; The individual parameters can be accessed through the $params slot. It is also possible to get information about all parameters in a vectorized fashion using mostly the same slots as for individual Params (i.e. $class, $levels etc.), see ?ParamSet for details. It is possible to reduce ParamSets using the $subset method. Be aware that it modifies a ParamSet in-place, so a “clone” must be created first if the original ParamSet should not be modified. psSmall = ps$clone() psSmall$subset(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)) print(psSmall) ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 2: B ParamInt 0 10 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; Just as for Params, and much more useful, it is possible to get the ParamSet as a data.table using as.data.table(). This makes it easy to subset parameters on certain conditions and aggregate information about them, using the variety of methods provided by data.table. as.data.table(ps) ## id class lower upper levels nlevels is_bounded special_vals default storage_type tags ## 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE 2 TRUE &lt;list[0]&gt; &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; logical ## 2: B ParamInt 0 10 11 TRUE &lt;list[0]&gt; &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; integer tag1,tag2 ## 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 Inf TRUE &lt;list[1]&gt; &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; numeric ## 4: D ParamFct NA NA x,y,z 3 TRUE &lt;list[0]&gt; y character ## 5: E ParamUty NA NA Inf FALSE &lt;list[0]&gt; &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; list 5.4.2.2.1 Type / Range Checking Similar to individual Params, the ParamSet provides $test(), $check() and $assert() functions that allow for type and range checking of parameters. Their argument must be a named list with values that are checked against the respective parameters. It is possible to check only a subset of parameters. ps$check(list(A = TRUE, B = 0, E = identity)) ## [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = 1)) ## [1] &quot;A: Must be of type &#39;logical flag&#39;, not &#39;double&#39;&quot; ps$check(list(Z = 1)) ## [1] &quot;Parameter &#39;Z&#39; not available. Did you mean &#39;A&#39; / &#39;B&#39; / &#39;C&#39;?&quot; 5.4.2.2.2 Values in a ParamSet Although a ParamSet fundamentally represents a value space, it also has a slot $values that can contain a point within that space. This is useful because many things that define a parameter space need similar operations (like parameter checking) that can be simplified. The $values slot contains a named list that is always checked against parameter constraints. When trying to set parameter values, e.g. for mlr3 Learners, it is the $values slot of its $param_set that needs to be used. ps$values = list(A = TRUE, B = 0) ps$values$B = 1 print(ps$values) ## $A ## [1] TRUE ## ## $B ## [1] 1 The parameter constraints are automatically checked: ps$values$B = 100 ## Error in self$assert(xs): Assertion on &#39;xs&#39; failed: B: Element 1 is not &lt;= 10. 5.4.2.2.3 Dependencies It is often the case that certain parameters are irrelevant or should not be given depending on values of other parameters. An example would be a parameter that switches a certain algorithm feature (for example regularization) on or off, combined with another parameter that controls the behavior of that feature (e.g. a regularization parameter). The second parameter would be said to depend on the first parameter having the value TRUE. A dependency can be added using the $add_dep method, which takes both the ids of the “depender” and “dependee” parameters as well as a Condition object. The Condition object represents the check to be performed on the “dependee”. Currently it can be created using CondEqual$new() and CondAnyOf$new(). Multiple dependencies can be added, and parameters that depend on others can again be depended on, as long as no cyclic dependencies are introduced. The consequence of dependencies are twofold: For one, the $check(), $test() and $assert() tests will not accept the presence of a parameter if its dependency is not met. Furthermore, when sampling or creating grid designs from a ParamSet, the dependencies will be respected (see Parameter Sampling, in particular Hierarchical Sampler). The following example makes parameter D depend on parameter A being FALSE, and parameter B depend on parameter D being one of \"x\" or \"y\". This introduces an implicit dependency of B on A being FALSE as well, because D does not take any value if A is TRUE. ps$add_dep(&quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, CondEqual$new(FALSE)) ps$add_dep(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, CondAnyOf$new(c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;))) ps$check(list(A = FALSE, D = &quot;x&quot;, B = 1)) # OK: all dependencies met ## [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = FALSE, D = &quot;z&quot;, B = 1)) # B&#39;s dependency is not met ## [1] &quot;The parameter &#39;B&#39; can only be set if the following condition is met &#39;D ∈ {x, y}&#39;. Instead the current parameter value is: D=z&quot; ps$check(list(A = FALSE, B = 1)) # B&#39;s dependency is not met ## [1] &quot;The parameter &#39;B&#39; can only be set if the following condition is met &#39;D ∈ {x, y}&#39;. Instead the parameter value for &#39;D&#39; is not set at all. Try setting &#39;D&#39; to a value that satisfies the condition&quot; ps$check(list(A = FALSE, D = &quot;z&quot;)) # OK: B is absent ## [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = TRUE)) # OK: neither B nor D present ## [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = TRUE, D = &quot;x&quot;, B = 1)) # D&#39;s dependency is not met ## [1] &quot;The parameter &#39;D&#39; can only be set if the following condition is met &#39;A = FALSE&#39;. Instead the current parameter value is: A=TRUE&quot; ps$check(list(A = TRUE, B = 1)) # B&#39;s dependency is not met ## [1] &quot;The parameter &#39;B&#39; can only be set if the following condition is met &#39;D ∈ {x, y}&#39;. Instead the parameter value for &#39;D&#39; is not set at all. Try setting &#39;D&#39; to a value that satisfies the condition&quot; Internally, the dependencies are represented as a data.table, which can be accessed listed in the $deps slot. This data.table can even be mutated, to e.g. remove dependencies. There are no sanity checks done when the $deps slot is changed this way. Therefore it is advised to be cautious. ps$deps ## id on cond ## 1: D A &lt;CondEqual[9]&gt; ## 2: B D &lt;CondAnyOf[9]&gt; 5.4.2.3 Vector Parameters Unlike in the old ParamHelpers package, there are no more vectorial parameters in paradox. Instead, it is now possible to create multiple copies of a single parameter using the $rep function. This creates a ParamSet consisting of multiple copies of the parameter, which can then (optionally) be added to another ParamSet. ps2d = ParamDbl$new(&quot;x&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 1)$rep(2) print(ps2d) ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: x_rep_1 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 2: x_rep_2 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ps$add(ps2d) print(ps) ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default parents value ## 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; TRUE ## 2: B ParamInt 0 10 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; D 1 ## 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 4: D ParamFct NA NA x,y,z y A ## 5: E ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 6: x_rep_1 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 7: x_rep_2 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; It is also possible to use a ParamUty to accept vectorial parameters, which also works for parameters of variable length. A ParamSet containing a ParamUty can be used for parameter checking, but not for sampling. To sample values for a method that needs a vectorial parameter, it is advised to use a parameter transformation function that creates a vector from atomic values. Assembling a vector from repeated parameters is aided by the parameter’s $tags: Parameters that were generated by the $rep() command automatically get tagged as belonging to a group of repeated parameters. ps$tags ## $A ## character(0) ## ## $B ## [1] &quot;tag1&quot; &quot;tag2&quot; ## ## $C ## character(0) ## ## $D ## character(0) ## ## $E ## character(0) ## ## $x_rep_1 ## [1] &quot;x_rep&quot; ## ## $x_rep_2 ## [1] &quot;x_rep&quot; 5.4.3 Parameter Sampling It is often useful to have a list of possible parameter values that can be systematically iterated through, for example to find parameter values for which an algorithm performs particularly well (tuning). paradox offers a variety of functions that allow creating evenly-spaced parameter values in a “grid” design as well as random sampling. In the latter case, it is possible to influence the sampling distribution in more or less fine detail. A point to always keep in mind while sampling is that only numerical and factorial parameters that are bounded can be sampled from, i.e. not ParamUty. Furthermore, for most samplers ParamInt and ParamDbl must have finite lower and upper bounds. 5.4.3.1 Parameter Designs Functions that sample the parameter space fundamentally return an object of the Design class. These objects contain the sampled data as a data.table under the $data slot, and also offer conversion to a list of parameter-values using the $transpose() function. 5.4.3.2 Grid Design The generate_design_grid() function is used to create grid designs that contain all combinations of parameter values: All possible values for ParamLgl and ParamFct, and values with a given resolution for ParamInt and ParamDbl. The resolution can be given for all numeric parameters, or for specific named parameters through the param_resolutions parameter. design = generate_design_grid(psSmall, 2) print(design) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 8 rows: ## A B C ## 1: TRUE 0 0 ## 2: TRUE 0 4 ## 3: TRUE 10 0 ## 4: TRUE 10 4 ## 5: FALSE 0 0 ## 6: FALSE 0 4 ## 7: FALSE 10 0 ## 8: FALSE 10 4 generate_design_grid(psSmall, param_resolutions = c(B = 1, C = 2)) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 4 rows: ## B C A ## 1: 0 0 TRUE ## 2: 0 0 FALSE ## 3: 0 4 TRUE ## 4: 0 4 FALSE 5.4.3.3 Random Sampling paradox offers different methods for random sampling, which vary in the degree to which they can be configured. The easiest way to get a uniformly random sample of parameters is generate_design_random. It is also possible to create “latin hypercube” sampled parameter values using generate_design_lhs, which utilizes the lhs package. LHS-sampling creates low-discrepancy sampled values that cover the parameter space more evenly than purely random values. pvrand = generate_design_random(ps2d, 500) pvlhs = generate_design_lhs(ps2d, 500) 5.4.3.4 Generalized Sampling: The Sampler Class It may sometimes be desirable to configure parameter sampling in more detail. paradox uses the Sampler abstract base class for sampling, which has many different sub-classes that can be parameterized and combined to control the sampling process. It is even possible to create further sub-classes of the Sampler class (or of any of its subclasses) for even more possibilities. Every Sampler object has a sample() function, which takes one argument, the number of instances to sample, and returns a Design object. 5.4.3.4.1 1D-Samplers There is a variety of samplers that sample values for a single parameter. These are Sampler1DUnif (uniform sampling), Sampler1DCateg (sampling for categorical parameters), Sampler1DNormal (normally distributed sampling, truncated at parameter bounds), and Sampler1DRfun (arbitrary 1D sampling, given a random-function). These are initialized with a single Param, and can then be used to sample values. sampA = Sampler1DCateg$new(parA) sampA$sample(5) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 5 rows: ## A ## 1: FALSE ## 2: TRUE ## 3: TRUE ## 4: FALSE ## 5: FALSE 5.4.3.4.2 Hierarchical Sampler The SamplerHierarchical sampler is an auxiliary sampler that combines many 1D-Samplers to get a combined distribution. Its name “hierarchical” implies that it is able to respect parameter dependencies. This suggests that parameters only get sampled when their dependencies are met. The following example shows how this works: The Int parameter B depends on the Lgl parameter A being TRUE. A is sampled to be TRUE in about half the cases, in which case B takes a value between 0 and 10. In the cases where A is FALSE, B is set to NA. psSmall$add_dep(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, CondEqual$new(TRUE)) sampH = SamplerHierarchical$new(psSmall, list(Sampler1DCateg$new(parA), Sampler1DUnif$new(parB), Sampler1DUnif$new(parC)) ) sampled = sampH$sample(1000) table(sampled$data[, c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)], useNA = &quot;ifany&quot;) ## B ## A 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 &lt;NA&gt; ## FALSE 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 489 ## TRUE 46 46 51 47 47 46 42 44 47 45 50 0 5.4.3.4.3 Joint Sampler Another way of combining samplers is the SamplerJointIndep. SamplerJointIndep also makes it possible to combine Samplers that are not 1D. However, SamplerJointIndep currently can not handle ParamSets with dependencies. sampJ = SamplerJointIndep$new( list(Sampler1DUnif$new(ParamDbl$new(&quot;x&quot;, 0, 1)), Sampler1DUnif$new(ParamDbl$new(&quot;y&quot;, 0, 1))) ) sampJ$sample(5) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 5 rows: ## x y ## 1: 0.5955 0.6202 ## 2: 0.8824 0.8642 ## 3: 0.5691 0.6143 ## 4: 0.4402 0.3402 ## 5: 0.8272 0.4745 5.4.3.4.4 SamplerUnif The Sampler used in generate_design_random is the SamplerUnif sampler, which corresponds to a HierarchicalSampler of Sampler1DUnif for all parameters. 5.4.4 Parameter Transformation While the different Samplers allow for a wide specification of parameter distributions, there are cases where the simplest way of getting a desired distribution is to sample parameters from a simple distribution (such as the uniform distribution) and then transform them. This can be done by assigning a function to the $trafo slot of a ParamSet. The $trafo function is called with two parameters: The list of parameter values to be transformed as x The ParamSet itself as param_set The $trafo function must return a list of transformed parameter values. The transformation is performed when calling the $transpose function of the Design object returned by a Sampler with the trafo ParamSet to TRUE (the default). The following, for example, creates a parameter that is exponentially distributed: psexp = ParamSet$new(list(ParamDbl$new(&quot;par&quot;, 0, 1))) psexp$trafo = function(x, param_set) { x$par = -log(x$par) x } design = generate_design_random(psexp, 2) print(design) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 2 rows: ## par ## 1: 0.4381 ## 2: 0.6073 design$transpose() # trafo is TRUE ## [[1]] ## [[1]]$par ## [1] 0.8253 ## ## ## [[2]] ## [[2]]$par ## [1] 0.4987 Compare this to $transpose() without transformation: design$transpose(trafo = FALSE) ## [[1]] ## [[1]]$par ## [1] 0.4381 ## ## ## [[2]] ## [[2]]$par ## [1] 0.6073 5.4.4.1 Transformation between Types Usually the design created with one ParamSet is then used to configure other objects that themselves have a ParamSet which defines the values they take. The ParamSets which can be used for random sampling, however, are restricted in some ways: They must have finite bounds, and they may not contain “untyped” (ParamUty) parameters. $trafo provides the glue for these situations. There is relatively little constraint on the trafo function’s return value, so it is possible to return values that have different bounds or even types than the original ParamSet. It is even possible to remove some parameters and add new ones. Suppose, for example, that a certain method requires a function as a parameter. Let’s say a function that summarizes its data in a certain way. The user can pass functions like median() or mean(), but could also pass quantiles or something completely different. This method would probably use the following ParamSet: methodPS = ParamSet$new( list( ParamUty$new(&quot;fun&quot;, custom_check = function(x) checkmate::checkFunction(x, nargs = 1)) ) ) print(methodPS) ## &lt;ParamSet&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: fun ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; If one wanted to sample this method, using one of four functions, a way to do this would be: samplingPS = ParamSet$new( list( ParamFct$new(&quot;fun&quot;, c(&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, &quot;max&quot;)) ) ) samplingPS$trafo = function(x, param_set) { # x$fun is a `character(1)`, # in particular one of &#39;mean&#39;, &#39;median&#39;, &#39;min&#39;, &#39;max&#39;. # We want to turn it into a function! x$fun = get(x$fun, mode = &quot;function&quot;) x } design = generate_design_random(samplingPS, 2) print(design) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 2 rows: ## fun ## 1: median ## 2: max Note that the Design only contains the column “fun” as a character column. To get a single value as a function, the $transpose function is used. xvals = design$transpose() print(xvals[[1]]) ## $fun ## function (x, na.rm = FALSE, ...) ## UseMethod(&quot;median&quot;) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x55deaa99ba18&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:stats&gt; We can now check that it fits the requirements set by methodPS, and that fun it is in fact a function: methodPS$check(xvals[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;fun: Must have exactly 1 formal arguments, but has 2&quot; xvals[[1]]$fun(1:10) ## [1] 5.5 Imagine now that a different kind of parametrization of the function is desired: The user wants to give a function that selects a certain quantile, where the quantile is set by a parameter. In that case the $transpose function could generate a function in a different way. For interpretability, the parameter is called “quantile” before transformation, and the “fun” parameter is generated on the fly. samplingPS2 = ParamSet$new( list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;quantile&quot;, 0, 1) ) ) samplingPS2$trafo = function(x, param_set) { # x$quantile is a `numeric(1)` between 0 and 1. # We want to turn it into a function! list(fun = function(input) quantile(input, x$quantile)) } design = generate_design_random(samplingPS2, 2) print(design) ## &lt;Design&gt; with 2 rows: ## quantile ## 1: 0.3437 ## 2: 0.2406 The Design now contains the column “quantile” that will be used by the $transpose function to create the fun parameter. We also check that it fits the requirement set by methodPS, and that it is a function. xvals = design$transpose() print(xvals[[1]]) ## $fun ## function(input) quantile(input, x$quantile) ## &lt;environment: 0x55deaf5306d8&gt; methodPS$check(xvals[[1]]) ## [1] TRUE xvals[[1]]$fun(1:10) ## 34.37% ## 4.093 Although the name is suggestive of a “Set”-valued Param, this is unrelated to the other objects that follow the ParamXxx naming scheme.↩︎ "],["logging.html", "5.5 Logging", " 5.5 Logging We use the lgr package for logging and progress output. 5.5.1 Changing mlr3 logging levels To change the setting for mlr3 for the current session, you need to retrieve the logger (which is a R6 object) from lgr, and then change the threshold of the like this: requireNamespace(&quot;lgr&quot;) logger = lgr::get_logger(&quot;mlr3&quot;) logger$set_threshold(&quot;&lt;level&gt;&quot;) The default log level is \"info\". All available levels can be listed as follows: getOption(&quot;lgr.log_levels&quot;) ## fatal error warn info debug trace ## 100 200 300 400 500 600 To increase verbosity, set the log level to a higher value, e.g. to \"debug\" with: lgr::get_logger(&quot;mlr3&quot;)$set_threshold(&quot;debug&quot;) To reduce the verbosity, reduce the log level to warn: lgr::get_logger(&quot;mlr3&quot;)$set_threshold(&quot;warn&quot;) lgr comes with a global option called \"lgr.default_threshold\" which can be set via options() to make your choice permanent across sessions. Also note that the optimization packages such as mlr3tuning mlr3fselect use the logger of their base package bbotk.

"],["extending-learners.html", "6.1 Adding new Learners", " 6.1 Adding new Learners Here, we show how to create a custom mlr3learner step-by-step using mlr3extralearners::create_learner. This section gives insights on how a mlr3learner is constructed and how to troubleshoot issues. See the Learner FAQ subsection for help. Summary of steps for adding a new learner Check the learner does not already exist here. (Install mlr3extralearners from GitHub: remotes::install_github(\"mlr-org/mlr3extralearners\").)

See meta information. predict_types = c(\"response\", \"prob\"), - Sets the possible prediction types as response (deterministic) and prob (probabilistic). See meta information. properties = c(\"importance\", \"missings\", \"multiclass\", \"selected_features\", \"twoclass\", \"weights\") - Sets the properties that are handled by the learner, by including \"importance\" a public method called importance will be created that must be manually filled. See meta information. references = TRUE - Tells the template to add a “references” tag that must be filled manually. gh_name = \"RaphaelS1\" - Fills the “author” tag with my GitHub handle, this is required as it identifies the maintainer of the learner. The sections below demonstrate what happens after the function has been run and the files that are created. 6.1.2 learner_package_type_key.R The first script to complete after running create_learner is the file with the form learner_package_type_key.R, in our case this will actually be learner_rpart_classif_rpart.key. This name must not be changed as triggering automated tests rely on a strict naming scheme. For our example, the resulting script looks like this: #&#39; @title Classification Decision Tree Learner #&#39; @author RaphaelS1 #&#39; @name mlr_learners_classif.rpart #&#39; #&#39; @template class_learner #&#39; @templateVar id classif.rpart #&#39; @templateVar caller rpart #&#39; #&#39; @references #&#39; &lt;FIXME - DELETE THIS AND LINE ABOVE IF OMITTED&gt; #&#39; #&#39; @template seealso_learner #&#39; @template example #&#39; @export LearnerClassifRpart = R6Class(&quot;LearnerClassifRpart&quot;, inherit = LearnerClassif, public = list( #&#39; @description #&#39; Creates a new instance of this [R6][R6::R6Class] class. initialize = function() { # FIXME - MANUALLY ADD PARAM_SET BELOW AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE ps = &lt;param_set&gt; # FIXME - MANUALLY UPDATE PARAM VALUES BELOW IF APPLICABLE THEN DELETE THIS LINE. # OTHERWISE DELETE THIS AND LINE BELOW. ps$values = list(&lt;param_vals&gt;) super$initialize( id = &quot;classif.rpart&quot;, packages = &quot;rpart&quot;, feature_types = c(&quot;logical&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;numeric&quot;, &quot;factor&quot;, &quot;ordered&quot;), predict_types = c(&quot;response&quot;, &quot;prob&quot;), param_set = ps, properties = c(&quot;importance&quot;, &quot;missings&quot;, &quot;multiclass&quot;, &quot;selected_features&quot;, &quot;twoclass&quot;, &quot;weights&quot;), man = &quot;mlr3extralearners::mlr_learners_classif.rpart&quot; ) }, # FIXME - ADD IMPORTANCE METHOD HERE AND DELETE THIS LINE. # &lt;See LearnerRegrRandomForest for an example&gt; #&#39; @description #&#39; The importance scores are extracted from the slot &lt;FIXME&gt;. #&#39; @return Named `numeric()`. importance = function() { } ), private = list( .train = function(task) { pars = self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;train&quot;) # set column names to ensure consistency in fit and predict self$state$feature_names = task$feature_names # FIXME - &lt;Create objects for the train call # &lt;At least &quot;data&quot; and &quot;formula&quot; are required&gt; formula = task$formula() data = task$data() # FIXME - &lt;here is space for some custom adjustments before proceeding to the # train call.

Fill in the private .predict method, which operates on the model in self$model (stored during $train()) and a (differently subsetted) Task to return a named list of predictions. 6.1.3 Meta-information In the constructor (initialize()) the constructor of the super class (e.g. LearnerClassif) is called with meta information about the learner which should be constructed. This includes: id: The ID of the new learner. Usually consists of &lt;type&gt;.&lt;algorithm&gt;, for example: \"classif.rpart\". packages: The upstream package name of the implemented learner. param_set: A set of hyperparameters and their descriptions provided as a paradox::ParamSet. For each hyperparameter the appropriate class needs to be chosen: paradox::ParamLgl for scalar logical hyperparameters. paradox::ParamInt for scalar integer hyperparameters. paradox::ParamDbl for scalar numeric hyperparameters. paradox::ParamFct for scalar factor hyperparameters (this includes characters). paradox::ParamUty for everything else (e.g. vector paramters or list parameters). predict_types: Set of predict types the learner is able to handle. These differ depending on the type of the learner. See mlr_reflections$learner_predict_types for the full list of feature types supported by mlr3. LearnerClassif response: Only predicts a class label for each observation in the test set. prob: Also predicts the posterior probability for each class for each observation in the test set. LearnerRegr response: Only predicts a numeric response for each observation in the test set. se: Also predicts the standard error for each value of response for each observation in the test set. feature_types: Set of feature types the learner is able to handle. See mlr_reflections$task_feature_types for feature types supported by mlr3. properties: Set of properties of the learner. See mlr_reflections$learner_properties for the full list of feature types supported by mlr3. Possible properties include: \"twoclass\": The learner works on binary classification problems. \"multiclass\": The learner works on multi-class classification problems. \"missings\": The learner can natively handle missing values. \"weights\": The learner can work on tasks which have observation weights / case weights. \"parallel\": The learner supports internal parallelization in some way. Currently not used, this is an experimental property. \"importance\": The learner supports extracting importance values for features. If this property is set, you must also implement a public method importance() to retrieve the importance values from the model. \"selected_features\": The learner supports extracting the features which where used. If this property is set, you must also implement a public method selected_features() to retrieve the set of used features from the model. man: The roxygen identifier of the learner. This is used within the $help() method of the super class to open the help page of the learner. 6.1.4 ParamSet The param_set is the set of hyperparameters used in model training and predicting, this is given as a paradox::ParamSet. The set consists of a list of hyperparameters, each has a specific class for the hyperparameter type: paradox::ParamLgl for scalar logical hyperparameters. paradox::ParamInt for scalar integer hyperparameters. paradox::ParamDbl for scalar numeric hyperparameters. paradox::ParamFct for scalar factor hyperparameters (this includes characters). paradox::ParamUty for everything else (e.g. vector or list parameters). For classif.rpart the following replace &lt;param_set&gt; above: ps = ParamSet$new(list( ParamInt$new(id = &quot;minsplit&quot;, default = 20L, lower = 1L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;minbucket&quot;, lower = 1L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;cp&quot;, default = 0.01, lower = 0, upper = 1, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;maxcompete&quot;, default = 4L, lower = 0L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;maxsurrogate&quot;, default = 5L, lower = 0L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;maxdepth&quot;, default = 30L, lower = 1L, upper = 30L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;usesurrogate&quot;, default = 2L, lower = 0L, upper = 2L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;surrogatestyle&quot;, default = 0L, lower = 0L, upper = 1L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;xval&quot;, default = 0L, lower = 0L, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamLgl$new(id = &quot;keep_model&quot;, default = FALSE, tags = &quot;train&quot;) )) ps$values = list(xval = 0L) You should read though the learner documentation to find the full list of available parameters. Just looking at some of these in this example: \"cp\" is numeric, has a feasible range of [0,1] and defaults to 0.01. The parameter is used during \"train\". \"xval\" is integer has a lower bound of 0, a default of 0 and the parameter is used during \"train\". \"keep_model\" is logical with a default of FALSE and is used during \"train\". In some rare cases you may want to change the default parameter values. You can do this by passing a list to &lt;param_vals&gt; in the template script above. You can see we have done this for \"classif.rpart\" where the default for xval is changed to 0. Note that the default in the ParamSet is recorded as our changed default (0), and not the original (10). It is strongly recommended to only change the defaults if absolutely required, when this is the case add the following to the learner documentation: #&#39; @section Custom mlr3 defaults: #&#39; - `&lt;parameter&gt;`: #&#39; - Actual default: &lt;value&gt; #&#39; - Adjusted default: &lt;value&gt; #&#39; - Reason for change: &lt;text&gt; 6.1.5 Train function Let’s talk about the .train() method. The train function takes a Task as input and must return a model. Let’s say we want to translate the following call of rpart::rpart() into code that can be used inside the .train() method. First, we write something down that works completely without mlr3: data = iris model = rpart::rpart(Species ~ ., data = iris, xval = 0) We need to pass the formula notation Species ~ ., the data and the hyperparameters. To get the hyperparameters, we call self$param_set$get_values() and query all parameters that are using during \"train\". The dataset is extracted from the Task. Last, we call the upstream function rpart::rpart() with the data and pass all hyperparameters via argument .args using the mlr3misc::invoke() function. The latter is simply an optimized version of do.call() that we use within the mlr3 ecosystem. .train = function(task) { pars = self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;train&quot;) formula = task$formula() data = task$data() mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, formula = formula, data = data, .args = pars) } 6.1.6 Predict function The internal predict method .predict() also operates on a Task as well as on the fitted model that has been created by the train() call previously and has been stored in self$model. The return value is a Prediction object. We proceed analogously to what we did in the previous section. We start with a version without any mlr3 objects and continue to replace objects until we have reached the desired interface: # inputs: task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) self = list(model = rpart::rpart(task$formula(), data = task$data())) data = iris response = predict(self$model, newdata = data, type = &quot;class&quot;) prob = predict(self$model, newdata = data, type = &quot;prob&quot;) The rpart::predict.rpart() function predicts class labels if argument type is set to to \"class\", and class probabilities if set to \"prob\". Next, we transition from data to a task again and construct a list with the return type requested by the user, this is stored in the $predict_type slot of a learner class. Note that the task is automatically passed to the prediction object, so all you need to do is return the predictions! Make sure the list names are identical to the task predict types. The final .predict() method is below, we could omit the pars line as there are no parameters with the \"predict\" tag but we keep it here to be consistent: .predict = function(task) { pars = self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;predict&quot;) # get newdata and ensure same ordering in train and predict newdata = task$data(cols = self$state$feature_names) if (self$predict_type == &quot;response&quot;) { response = mlr3misc::invoke(predict, self$model, newdata = newdata, type = &quot;class&quot;, .args = pars) return(list(response = response)) } else { prob = mlr3misc::invoke(predict, self$model, newdata = newdata, type = &quot;prob&quot;, .args = pars) return(list(prob = prob)) } } Note that you cannot rely on the column order of the data returned by task$data() as the order of columns may be different from the order of the columns during $.train. The newdata line ensures the ordering is the same by calling the saved order set in $.train, don’t delete either of these lines! 6.1.7 Control objects/functions of learners Some learners rely on a “control” object/function such as glmnet::glmnet.control(). Accounting for such depends on how the underlying package works: If the package forwards the control parameters via ... and makes it possible to just pass control parameters as additional parameters directly to the train call, there is no need to distinguish both \"train\" and \"control\" parameters. Both can be tagged with “train” in the ParamSet and just be handed over as shown previously. If the control parameters need to be passed via a separate argument, the parameters should also be tagged accordingly in the ParamSet. Afterwards they can be queried via their tag and passed separately to mlr3misc::invoke(). See example below. control_pars = mlr3misc::(&lt;package&gt;::&lt;function&gt;, self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;control&quot;)) train_pars = self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;train&quot;)) mlr3misc::invoke([...], .args = train_pars, control = control_pars) 6.1.8 Testing the learner Once your learner is created, you are ready to start testing if it works, there are three types of tests: manual, unit and parameter. 6.1.8.1 Train and Predict For a bare-bone check you can just try to run a simple train() call locally. task = tsk(&quot;iris&quot;) # assuming a Classif learner lrn = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) lrn$train(task) p = lrn$predict(task) p$confusion If it runs without erroring, that’s a very good start! 6.1.8.2 Autotest To ensure that your learner is able to handle all kinds of different properties and feature types, we have written an “autotest” that checks the learner for different combinations of such. The “autotest” setup is generated automatically by create_learner and will open after running the function, it will have a name with the form test_package_type_key.R, in our case this will actually be test_rpart_classif_rpart.key. This name must not be changed as triggering automated tests rely on a strict naming scheme. In our example this will create the following script, for which no changes are required to pass (assuming the learner was correctly created): install_learners(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) test_that(&quot;autotest&quot;, { learner = LearnerClassifRpart$new() expect_learner(learner) result = run_autotest(learner) expect_true(result, info = result$error) }) For some learners that have required parameters, it is needed to set some values for required parameters after construction so that the learner can be run in the first place. You can also exclude some specific test arrangements within the “autotest” via the argument exclude in the run_autotest() function. Currently the run_autotest() function lives in inst/testthat of the mlr_plkg(\"mlr3\") and still lacks documentation. This should change in the near future. To finally run the test suite, call devtools::test() or hit CTRL + Shift + T if you are using RStudio. 6.1.8.3 Checking Parameters Some learners have a high number of parameters and it is easy to miss out on some during the creation of a new learner. In addition, if the maintainer of the upstream package changes something with respect to the arguments of the algorithm, the learner is in danger to break. Also, new arguments could be added upstream and manually checking for new additions all the time is tedious. Therefore we have written a “Parameter Check” that runs for every learner asynchronously to the R CMD Check of the package itself. This “Parameter Check” compares the parameters of the mlr3 ParamSet against all arguments available in the upstream function that is called during $train() and $predict(). Again the file is automatically created and opened by create_learner, this will be named like test_paramtest_package_type_key.R, so in our example test_paramtest_rpart_classif_rpart.R. The test comes with an exclude argument that should be used to exclude and explain why certain arguments of the upstream function are not within the ParamSet of the mlr3learner. This will likely be required for all learners as common arguments like x, target or data are handled by the mlr3 interface and are therefore not included within the ParamSet. However, there might be more parameters that need to be excluded, for example: Type dependent parameters, i.e. parameters that only apply for classification or regression learners. Parameters that are actually deprecated by the upstream package and which were therefore not included in the mlr3 ParamSet. All excluded parameters should have a comment justifying their exclusion. In our example, the final paramtest script looks like: library(mlr3extralearners) install_learners(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) test_that(&quot;classif.rpart train&quot;, { learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) fun = rpart::rpart exclude = c( &quot;formula&quot;,# handled internally &quot;model&quot;, # handled internally &quot;data&quot;, # handled internally &quot;weights&quot;, # handled by task &quot;subset&quot;, # handled by task &quot;na.action&quot;, # handled internally &quot;method&quot;, # handled internally &quot;x&quot;, # handled internally &quot;y&quot;, # handled internally &quot;parms&quot;, # handled internally &quot;control&quot;, # handled internally &quot;cost&quot; # handled internally ) ParamTest = run_paramtest(learner, fun, exclude) expect_true(ParamTest, info = paste0( &quot;Missing parameters:&quot;, paste0(&quot;- &#39;&quot;, ParamTest$missing, &quot;&#39;&quot;, collapse = &quot; &quot;))) }) test_that(&quot;classif.rpart predict&quot;, { learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) fun = rpart:::predict.rpart exclude = c( &quot;object&quot;, # handled internally &quot;newdata&quot;, # handled internally &quot;type&quot;, # handled internally &quot;na.action&quot; # handled internally ) ParamTest = run_paramtest(learner, fun, exclude) expect_true(ParamTest, info = paste0( &quot;Missing parameters:&quot;, paste0(&quot;- &#39;&quot;, ParamTest$missing, &quot;&#39;&quot;, collapse = &quot; &quot;))) }) 6.1.9 Package Cleaning Once all tests are passing, run the following functions to ensure that the package remains clean and tidy devtools::document(roclets = c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace')) If you haven’t done this before run: remotes::install_github('pat-s/styler@mlr-style') styler::style_pkg(style = styler::mlr_style) usethis::use_tidy_description() lintr::lint_package() Please fix any errors indicated by lintr before creating a pull request. Finally ensure that all FIXME are resolved and deleted in the generated files. You are now ready to add your learner to the mlr3 ecosystem! Simply open a pull request to with the new learner template and complete the checklist in there. Once the pull request is approved and merged, your learner will automatically appear on the package website. 6.1.10 Thanks and Maintenance Thank you for contributing to the mlr3 ecosystem! When you created the learner you would have given your GitHub handle, meaning that you are now listed as the learner author and maintainer. This means that if the learner breaks it is your responsibility to fix the learner - you can view the status of your learner here. 6.1.11 Learner FAQ Question 1 How to deal with Parameters which have no default? Answer If the learner does not work without providing a value, set a reasonable default in param_set$values, add tag \"required\" to the parameter and document your default properly. Question 2 Where to add the package of the upstream package in the DESCRIPTION file? Add it to the “Imports” section. This will install the upstream package during the installation of the mlr3learner if it has not yet been installed by the user. Question 3 How to handle arguments from external “control” functions such as glmnet::glmnet_control()? Answer See “Control objects/functions of learners”. Question 4 How to document if my learner uses a custom default value that differs to the default of the upstream package? Answer If you set a custom default for the mlr3learner that does not cope with the one of the upstream package (think twice if this is really needed!), add this information to the help page of the respective learner. You can use the following skeleton for this: #&#39; @section Custom mlr3 defaults: #&#39; - `&lt;parameter&gt;`: #&#39; - Actual default: &lt;value&gt; #&#39; - Adjusted default: &lt;value&gt; #&#39; - Reason for change: &lt;text&gt; Question 5 When should the \"required\" tag be used when defining Params and what is its purpose? Answer The \"required\" tag should be used when the following conditions are met: The upstream function cannot be run without setting this parameter, i.e. it would throw an error. The parameter has no default in the upstream function. In mlr3 we follow the principle that every learner should be constructable without setting custom parameters. Therefore, if a parameter has no default in the upstream function, a custom value is usually set for this parameter in the mlr3learner (remember to document such changes in the help page of the learner). Even though this practice ensures that no parameter is unset in an mlr3learner and partially removes the usefulness of the \"required\" tag, the tag is still useful in the following scenario: If a user sets custom parameters after construction of the learner lrn = lrn(&quot;&lt;id&gt;&quot;) lrn$param_set$values = list(&quot;&lt;param&gt;&quot; = &lt;value&gt;) Here, all parameters besides the ones set in the list would be unset. See paradox::ParamSet for more information. If a parameter is tagged as \"required\" in the ParamSet, the call above would error and prompt the user that required parameters are missing. "],["extending-measures.html", "6.2 Adding new Measures", " 6.2 Adding new Measures In this section we showcase how to implement a custom performance measure. A good starting point is writing down the loss function independently of mlr3 (we also did this in the mlr3measures package). Here, we illustrate writing measure by implementing the root of the mean squared error for regression problems: root_mse = function(truth, response) { mse = mean((truth - response)^2) sqrt(mse) } root_mse(c(0, 0.5, 1), c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) ## [1] 0.4082 In the next step, we embed the root_mse() function into a new R6 class inheriting from base classes MeasureRegr/Measure. For classification measures, use MeasureClassif. We keep it simple here and only explain the most important parts of the Measure class: MeasureRootMSE = R6::R6Class(&quot;MeasureRootMSE&quot;, inherit = mlr3::MeasureRegr, public = list( initialize = function() { super$initialize( # custom id for the measure id = &quot;root_mse&quot;, # additional packages required to calculate this measure packages = character(), # properties, see below properties = character(), # required predict type of the learner predict_type = &quot;response&quot;, # feasible range of values range = c(0, Inf), # minimize during tuning? minimize = TRUE ) } ), private = list( # custom scoring function operating on the prediction object .score = function(prediction, ...) { root_mse = function(truth, response) { mse = mean((truth - response)^2) sqrt(mse) } root_mse(prediction$truth, prediction$response) } ) ) This class can be used as template for most performance measures. If something is missing, you might want to consider having a deeper dive into the following arguments: properties: If you tag you measure with the property \"requires_task\", the Task is automatically passed to your .score() function (don’t forget to add the argument task in the signature). The same is possible with \"requires_learner\" if you need to operate on the Learner and \"requires_train_set\" if you want to access the set of training indices in the score function. aggregator: This function (defaulting to mean()) controls how multiple performance scores, i.e. from different resampling iterations, are aggregated into a single numeric value if average is set to micro averaging. This is ignored for macro averaging. predict_sets: Prediction sets (subset of (\"train\", \"test\")) to operate on. Defaults to the “test” set. Finally, if you want to use your custom measure just like any other measure shipped with mlr3 and access it via the mlr_measures dictionary, you can easily add it: mlr3::mlr_measures$add(&quot;root_mse&quot;, MeasureRootMSE) Typically it is a good idea to put the measure together with the call to mlr_measures$add() in a new R file and just source it in your project. ## source(&quot;measure_root_mse.R&quot;) msr(&quot;root_mse&quot;) ## &lt;MeasureRootMSE:root_mse&gt; ## * Packages: - ## * Range: [0, Inf] ## * Minimize: TRUE ## * Properties: - ## * Predict type: response "],["extending-pipeops.html", "6.3 Adding new PipeOps", " 6.3 Adding new PipeOps This section showcases how the mlr3pipelines package can be extended to include custom PipeOps. To run the following examples, we will need a Task; we are using the well-known “Iris” task: library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) task$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 ## --- ## 146: virginica 5.2 2.3 6.7 3.0 ## 147: virginica 5.0 1.9 6.3 2.5 ## 148: virginica 5.2 2.0 6.5 3.0 ## 149: virginica 5.4 2.3 6.2 3.4 ## 150: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 mlr3pipelines is fundamentally built around R6. When planning to create custom PipeOp objects, it can only help to familiarize yourself with it. In principle, all a PipeOp must do is inherit from the PipeOp R6 class and implement the .train() and .predict() functions. There are, however, several auxiliary subclasses that can make the creation of certain operations much easier. 6.3.1 General Case Example: PipeOpCopy A very simple yet useful PipeOp is PipeOpCopy, which takes a single input and creates a variable number of output channels, all of which receive a copy of the input data. It is a simple example that showcases the important steps in defining a custom PipeOp. We will show a simplified version here, PipeOpCopyTwo, that creates exactly two copies of its input data. The following figure visualizes how our PipeOp is situated in the Pipeline and the significant in- and outputs. 6.3.1.1 First Steps: Inheriting from PipeOp The first part of creating a custom PipeOp is inheriting from PipeOp. We make a mental note that we need to implement a .train() and a .predict() function, and that we probably want to have an initialize() as well: PipeOpCopyTwo = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpCopyTwo&quot;, inherit = mlr3pipelines::PipeOp, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;copy.two&quot;) { .... }, ), private == list( .train = function(inputs) { .... }, .predict = function(inputs) { .... } ) ) Note, that private methods, e.g. .train and .predict etc are prefixed with a .. 6.3.1.2 Channel Definitions We need to tell the PipeOp the layout of its channels: How many there are, what their names are going to be, and what types are acceptable. This is done on initialization of the PipeOp (using a super$initialize call) by giving the input and output data.table objects. These must have three columns: a \"name\" column giving the names of input and output channels, and a \"train\" and \"predict\" column naming the class of objects we expect during training and prediction as input / output. A special value for these classes is \"*\", which indicates that any class will be accepted; our simple copy operator accepts any kind of input, so this will be useful. We have only one input, but two output channels. By convention, we name a single channel \"input\" or \"output\", and a group of channels [\"input1\", \"input2\", …], unless there is a reason to give specific different names. Therefore, our input data.table will have a single row &lt;\"input\", \"*\", \"*\"&gt;, and our output table will have two rows, &lt;\"output1\", \"*\", \"*\"&gt; and &lt;\"output2\", \"*\", \"*\"&gt;. All of this is given to the PipeOp creator. Our initialize() will thus look as follows: initialize = function(id = &quot;copy.two&quot;) { input = data.table::data.table(name = &quot;input&quot;, train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot;) # the following will create two rows and automatically fill the `train` # and `predict` cols with &quot;*&quot; output = data.table::data.table( name = c(&quot;output1&quot;, &quot;output2&quot;), train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot; ) super$initialize(id, input = input, output = output ) } 6.3.1.3 Train and Predict Both .train() and .predict() will receive a list as input and must give a list in return. According to our input and output definitions, we will always get a list with a single element as input, and will need to return a list with two elements. Because all we want to do is create two copies, we will just create the copies using c(inputs, inputs). Two things to consider: The .train() function must always modify the self$state variable to something that is not NULL or NO_OP. This is because the $state slot is used as a signal that PipeOp has been trained on data, even if the state itself is not important to the PipeOp (as in our case). Therefore, our .train() will set self$state = list(). It is not necessary to “clone” our input or make deep copies, because we don’t modify the data. However, if we were changing a reference-passed object, for example by changing data in a Task, we would have to make a deep copy first. This is because a PipeOp may never modify its input object by reference. Our .train() and .predict() functions are now: .train = function(inputs) { self$state = list() c(inputs, inputs) } .predict = function(inputs) { c(inputs, inputs) } 6.3.1.4 Putting it Together The whole definition thus becomes PipeOpCopyTwo = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpCopyTwo&quot;, inherit = mlr3pipelines::PipeOp, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;copy.two&quot;) { super$initialize(id, input = data.table::data.table(name = &quot;input&quot;, train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot;), output = data.table::data.table(name = c(&quot;output1&quot;, &quot;output2&quot;), train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot;) ) } ), private = list( .train = function(inputs) { self$state = list() c(inputs, inputs) }, .predict = function(inputs) { c(inputs, inputs) } ) ) We can create an instance of our PipeOp, put it in a graph, and see what happens when we train it on something: library(&quot;mlr3pipelines&quot;) poct = PipeOpCopyTwo$new() gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(poct) print(gr) ## Graph with 1 PipeOps: ## ID State sccssors prdcssors ## copy.two &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; result = gr$train(task) str(result) ## List of 2 ## $ copy.two.output1:Classes &#39;TaskClassif&#39;, &#39;TaskSupervised&#39;, &#39;Task&#39;, &#39;R6&#39; &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; ## $ copy.two.output2:Classes &#39;TaskClassif&#39;, &#39;TaskSupervised&#39;, &#39;Task&#39;, &#39;R6&#39; &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; 6.3.2 Special Case: Preprocessing Many PipeOps perform an operation on exactly one Task, and return exactly one Task. They may even not care about the “Target” / “Outcome” variable of that task, and only do some modification of some input data. However, it is usually important to them that the Task on which they perform prediction has the same data columns as the Task on which they train. For these cases, the auxiliary base class PipeOpTaskPreproc exists. It inherits from PipeOp itself, and other PipeOps should use it if they fall in the kind of use-case named above. When inheriting from PipeOpTaskPreproc, one must either implement the private methods .train_task() and .predict_task(), or the methods .train_dt(), .predict_dt(), depending on whether wants to operate on a Task object or on its data as data.tables. In the second case, one can optionally also overload the .select_cols() method, which chooses which of the incoming Task’s features are given to the .train_dt() / .predict_dt() functions. The following will show two examples: PipeOpDropNA, which removes a Task’s rows with missing values during training (and implements .train_task() and .predict_task()), and PipeOpScale, which scales a Task’s numeric columns (and implements .train_dt(), .predict_dt(), and .select_cols()). 6.3.2.1 Example: PipeOpDropNA Dropping rows with missing values may be important when training a model that can not handle them. Because mlr3 Tasks only contain a view to the underlying data, it is not necessary to modify data to remove rows with missing values. Instead, the rows can be removed using the Task’s $filter method, which modifies the Task in-place. This is done in the private method .train_task(). We take care that we also set the $state slot to signal that the PipeOp was trained. The private method .predict_task() does not need to do anything; removing missing values during prediction is not as useful, since learners that cannot handle them will just ignore the respective rows. Furthermore, mlr3 expects a Learner to always return just as many predictions as it was given input rows, so a PipeOp that removes Task rows during training can not be used inside a GraphLearner. When we inherit from PipeOpTaskPreproc, it sets the input and output data.tables for us to only accept a single Task. The only thing we do during initialize() is therefore to set an id (which can optionally be changed by the user). The complete PipeOpDropNA can therefore be written as follows. Note that it inherits from PipeOpTaskPreproc, unlike the PipeOpCopyTwo example from above: PipeOpDropNA = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpDropNA&quot;, inherit = mlr3pipelines::PipeOpTaskPreproc, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;drop.na&quot;) { super$initialize(id) } ), private = list( .train_task = function(task) { self$state = list() featuredata = task$data(cols = task$feature_names) exclude = apply(is.na(featuredata), 1, any) task$filter(task$row_ids[!exclude]) }, .predict_task = function(task) { # nothing to be done task } ) ) To test this PipeOp, we create a small task with missing values: smalliris = iris[(1:5) * 30, ] smalliris[1, 1] = NA smalliris[2, 2] = NA sitask = TaskClassif$new(&quot;smalliris&quot;, as_data_backend(smalliris), &quot;Species&quot;) print(sitask$data()) ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.6 0.2 NA 3.2 ## 2: versicolor 3.9 1.4 5.2 NA ## 3: versicolor 4.0 1.3 5.5 2.5 ## 4: virginica 5.0 1.5 6.0 2.2 ## 5: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 We test this by feeding it to a new Graph that uses PipeOpDropNA. gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(PipeOpDropNA$new()) filtered_task = gr$train(sitask)[[1]] print(filtered_task$data()) ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: versicolor 4.0 1.3 5.5 2.5 ## 2: virginica 5.0 1.5 6.0 2.2 ## 3: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 6.3.2.2 Example: PipeOpScaleAlways An often-applied preprocessing step is to simply center and/or scale the data to mean \\(0\\) and standard deviation \\(1\\). This fits the PipeOpTaskPreproc pattern quite well. Because it always replaces all columns that it operates on, and does not require any information about the task’s target, it only needs to overload the .train_dt() and .predict_dt() functions. This saves some boilerplate-code from getting the correct feature columns out of the task, and replacing them after modification. Because scaling only makes sense on numeric features, we want to instruct PipeOpTaskPreproc to give us only these numeric columns. We do this by overloading the .select_cols() function: It is called by the class to determine which columns to pass to .train_dt() and .predict_dt(). Its input is the Task that is being transformed, and it should return a character vector of all features to work with. When it is not overloaded, it uses all columns; instead, we will set it to only give us numeric columns. Because the levels() of the data table given to .train_dt() and .predict_dt() may be different from the task’s levels, these functions must also take a levels argument that is a named list of column names indicating their levels. When working with numeric data, this argument can be ignored, but it should be used instead of levels(dt[[column]]) for factorial or character columns. This is the first PipeOp where we will be using the $state slot for something useful: We save the centering offset and scaling coefficient and use it in $.predict()! For simplicity, we are not using hyperparameters and will always scale and center all data. Compare this PipeOpScaleAlways operator to the one defined inside the mlr3pipelines package, PipeOpScale. PipeOpScaleAlways = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpScaleAlways&quot;, inherit = mlr3pipelines::PipeOpTaskPreproc, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;scale.always&quot;) { super$initialize(id = id) } ), private = list( .select_cols = function(task) { task$feature_types[type == &quot;numeric&quot;, id] }, .train_dt = function(dt, levels, target) { sc = scale(as.matrix(dt)) self$state = list( center = attr(sc, &quot;scaled:center&quot;), scale = attr(sc, &quot;scaled:scale&quot;) ) sc }, .predict_dt = function(dt, levels) { t((t(dt) - self$state$center) / self$state$scale) } ) ) (Note for the observant: If you check PipeOpScale.R from the mlr3pipelines package, you will notice that is uses “get(\"type\")” and “get(\"id\")” instead of “type” and “id”, because the static code checker on CRAN would otherwise complain about references to undefined variables. This is a “problem” with data.table and not exclusive to mlr3pipelines.) We can, again, create a new Graph that uses this PipeOp to test it. Compare the resulting data to the original “iris” Task data printed at the beginning: gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(PipeOpScaleAlways$new()) result = gr$train(task) result[[1]]$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -0.89767 1.01560 ## 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.13920 -0.13154 ## 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -1.38073 0.32732 ## 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -1.50149 0.09789 ## 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.01844 1.24503 ## --- ## 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.03454 -0.13154 ## 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 0.55149 -1.27868 ## 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 0.79301 -0.13154 ## 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 0.43072 0.78617 ## 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 0.06843 -0.13154 6.3.3 Special Case: Preprocessing with Simple Train It is possible to make even further simplifications for many PipeOps that perform mostly the same operation during training and prediction. The point of Task preprocessing is often to modify the training data in mostly the same way as prediction data (but in a way that may depend on training data). Consider constant feature removal, for example: The goal is to remove features that have no variance, or only a single factor level. However, what features get removed must be decided during training, and may only depend on training data. Furthermore, the actual process of removing features is the same during training and prediction. A simplification to make is therefore to have a private method .get_state(task) which sets the $state slot during training, and a private method .transform(task), which gets called both during training and prediction. This is done in the PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple class. Just like PipeOpTaskPreproc, one can inherit from this and overload these functions to get a PipeOp that performs preprocessing with very little boilerplate code. Just like PipeOpTaskPreproc, PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple offers the possibility to instead overload the .get_state_dt(dt, levels) and .transform_dt(dt, levels) methods (and optionally, again, the .select_cols(task) function) to operate on data.table feature data instead of the whole Task. Even some methods that do not use PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple could work in a similar way: The PipeOpScaleAlways example from above will be shown to also work with this paradigm. 6.3.3.1 Example: PipeOpDropConst A typical example of a preprocessing operation that does almost the same operation during training and prediction is an operation that drops features depending on a criterion that is evaluated during training. One simple example of this is dropping constant features. Because the mlr3 Task class offers a flexible view on underlying data, it is most efficient to drop columns from the task directly using its $select() function, so the .get_state_dt(dt, levels) / .transform_dt(dt, levels) functions will not get used; instead we overload the .get_state(task) and .transform(task) methods. The .get_state() function’s result is saved to the $state slot, so we want to return something that is useful for dropping features. We choose to save the names of all the columns that have nonzero variance. For brevity, we use length(unique(column)) &gt; 1 to check whether more than one distinct value is present; a more sophisticated version could have a tolerance parameter for numeric values that are very close to each other. The .transform() method is evaluated both during training and prediction, and can rely on the $state slot being present. All it does here is call the Task$select function with the columns we chose to keep. The full PipeOp could be written as follows: PipeOpDropConst = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpDropConst&quot;, inherit = mlr3pipelines::PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;drop.const&quot;) { super$initialize(id = id) } ), private = list( .get_state = function(task) { data = task$data(cols = task$feature_names) nonconst = sapply(data, function(column) length(unique(column)) &gt; 1) list(cnames = colnames(data)[nonconst]) }, .transform = function(task) { task$select(self$state$cnames) } ) ) This can be tested using the first five rows of the “Iris” Task, for which one feature (\"Petal.Width\") is constant: irishead = task$clone()$filter(1:5) irishead$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 gr = Graph$new()$add_pipeop(PipeOpDropConst$new()) dropped_task = gr$train(irishead)[[1]] dropped_task$data() ## Species Petal.Length Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 5.0 3.6 We can also see that the $state was correctly set. Calling $.predict() with this graph, even with different data (the whole Iris Task!) will still drop the \"Petal.Width\" column, as it should. gr$pipeops$drop.const$state ## $cnames ## [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; ## ## $affected_cols ## [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; ## ## $intasklayout ## id type ## 1: Petal.Length numeric ## 2: Petal.Width numeric ## 3: Sepal.Length numeric ## 4: Sepal.Width numeric ## ## $outtasklayout ## id type ## 1: Petal.Length numeric ## 2: Sepal.Length numeric ## 3: Sepal.Width numeric ## ## $outtaskshell ## Empty data.table (0 rows and 4 cols): Species,Petal.Length,Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width dropped_predict = gr$predict(task)[[1]] dropped_predict$data() ## Species Petal.Length Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 5.0 3.6 ## --- ## 146: virginica 5.2 6.7 3.0 ## 147: virginica 5.0 6.3 2.5 ## 148: virginica 5.2 6.5 3.0 ## 149: virginica 5.4 6.2 3.4 ## 150: virginica 5.1 5.9 3.0 6.3.3.2 Example: PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple This example will show how a PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple can be used when only working on feature data in form of a data.table. Instead of calling the scale() function, the center and scale values are calculated directly and saved to the $state slot. The .transform_dt() function will then perform the same operation during both training and prediction: subtract the center and divide by the scale value. As in the PipeOpScaleAlways example above, we use .select_cols() so that we only work on numeric columns. PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple&quot;, inherit = mlr3pipelines::PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;scale.always.simple&quot;) { super$initialize(id = id) } ), private = list( .select_cols = function(task) { task$feature_types[type == &quot;numeric&quot;, id] }, .get_state_dt = function(dt, levels, target) { list( center = sapply(dt, mean), scale = sapply(dt, sd) ) }, .transform_dt = function(dt, levels) { t((t(dt) - self$state$center) / self$state$scale) } ) ) We can compare this PipeOp to the one above to show that it behaves the same. gr = Graph$new()$add_pipeop(PipeOpScaleAlways$new()) result_posa = gr$train(task)[[1]] gr = Graph$new()$add_pipeop(PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple$new()) result_posa_simple = gr$train(task)[[1]] result_posa$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -0.89767 1.01560 ## 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.13920 -0.13154 ## 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -1.38073 0.32732 ## 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -1.50149 0.09789 ## 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.01844 1.24503 ## --- ## 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.03454 -0.13154 ## 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 0.55149 -1.27868 ## 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 0.79301 -0.13154 ## 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 0.43072 0.78617 ## 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 0.06843 -0.13154 result_posa_simple$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -0.89767 1.01560 ## 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.13920 -0.13154 ## 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -1.38073 0.32732 ## 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -1.50149 0.09789 ## 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.01844 1.24503 ## --- ## 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.03454 -0.13154 ## 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 0.55149 -1.27868 ## 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 0.79301 -0.13154 ## 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 0.43072 0.78617 ## 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 0.06843 -0.13154 6.3.4 Hyperparameters mlr3pipelines uses the paradox package to define parameter spaces for PipeOps. Parameters for PipeOps can modify their behavior in certain ways, e.g. switch centering or scaling off in the PipeOpScale operator. The unified interface makes it possible to have parameters for whole Graphs that modify the individual PipeOp’s behavior. The Graphs, when encapsulated in GraphLearners, can even be tuned using the tuning functionality in mlr3tuning. Hyperparameters are declared during initialization, when calling the PipeOp’s $initialize() function, by giving a param_set argument. The param_set must be a ParamSet from the paradox package; see the mlr3book for more information on how to define parameter spaces. After construction, the ParamSet can be accessed through the $param_set slot. While it is possible to modify this ParamSet, using e.g. the $add() and $add_dep() functions, after adding it to the PipeOp, it is strongly advised against. Hyperparameters can be set and queried through the $values slot. When setting hyperparameters, they are automatically checked to satisfy all conditions set by the $param_set, so it is not necessary to type check them. Be aware that it is always possible to remove hyperparameter values. When a PipeOp is initialized, it usually does not have any parameter values—$values takes the value list(). It is possible to set initial parameter values in the $initialize() constructor; this must be done after the super$initialize() call where the corresponding ParamSet must be supplied. This is because setting $values checks against the current $param_set, which would fail if the $param_set was not set yet. When using an underlying library function (the scale function in PipeOpScale, say), then there is usually a “default” behaviour of that function when a parameter is not given. It is good practice to use this default behaviour whenever a parameter is not set (or when it was removed). This can easily be done when using the mlr3misc library’s mlr3misc::invoke() function, which has functionality similar to do.call(). 6.3.4.1 Hyperparameter Example: PipeOpScale How to use hyperparameters can best be shown through the example of PipeOpScale, which is very similar to the example above, PipeOpScaleAlways. The difference is made by the presence of hyperparameters. PipeOpScale constructs a ParamSet in its $initialize function and passes this on to the super$initialize function: PipeOpScale$public_methods$initialize ## function (id = &quot;scale&quot;, param_vals = list()) ## .__PipeOpScale__initialize(self = self, private = private, super = super, ## id = id, param_vals = param_vals) ## &lt;environment: namespace:mlr3pipelines&gt; The user has access to this and can set and get parameters. Types are automatically checked: pss = PipeOpScale$new() print(pss$param_set) ## &lt;ParamSet:scale&gt; ## id class lower upper levels default value ## 1: center ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE TRUE ## 2: scale ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE TRUE ## 3: robust ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; FALSE ## 4: affect_columns ParamUty NA NA &lt;Selector[1]&gt; pss$param_set$values$center = FALSE print(pss$param_set$values) ## $robust ## [1] FALSE ## ## $center ## [1] FALSE pss$param_set$values$scale = &quot;TRUE&quot; # bad input is checked! ## Error in self$assert(xs): Assertion on &#39;xs&#39; failed: scale: Must be of type &#39;logical flag&#39;, not &#39;character&#39;. How PipeOpScale handles its parameters can be seen in its $.train_dt method: It gets the relevant parameters from its $values slot and uses them in the mlr3misc::invoke() call. This has the advantage over calling scale() directly that if a parameter is not given, its default value from the scale() function will be used. PipeOpScale$private_methods$.train_dt ## function (dt, levels, target) ## .__PipeOpScale__.train_dt(self = self, private = private, super = super, ## dt = dt, levels = levels, target = target) ## &lt;environment: namespace:mlr3pipelines&gt; Another change that is necessary compared to PipeOpScaleAlways is that the attributes \"scaled:scale\" and \"scaled:center\" are not always present, depending on parameters, and possibly need to be set to default values \\(1\\) or \\(0\\), respectively. It is now even possible (if a bit pointless) to call PipeOpScale with both scale and center set to FALSE, which returns the original dataset, unchanged. pss$param_set$values$scale = FALSE pss$param_set$values$center = FALSE gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(pss) result = gr$train(task) result[[1]]$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 ## --- ## 146: virginica 5.2 2.3 6.7 3.0 ## 147: virginica 5.0 1.9 6.3 2.5 ## 148: virginica 5.2 2.0 6.5 3.0 ## 149: virginica 5.4 2.3 6.2 3.4 ## 150: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 "],["special-tasks.html", "7 Special Tasks", " 7 Special Tasks This chapter explores the different functions of mlr3 when dealing with specific data sets that require further statistical modification to undertake sensible analysis. Following topics are discussed: Survival Analysis This sub-chapter explains how to conduct sound survival analysis in mlr3. Survival analysis is used to monitor the period of time until a specific event takes places. This specific event could be e.g. death, transmission of a disease, marriage or divorce. Two considerations are important when conducting survival analysis: Whether the event occurred within the frame of the given data How much time it took until the event occurred In summary, this sub-chapter explains how to account for these considerations and conduct survival analysis using the mlr3proba extension package. Density Estimation This sub-chapter explains how to conduct (unconditional) density estimation in mlr3. Density estimation is used to estimate the probability density function of a continuous variable. Unconditional density estimation is an unsupervised task so there is no ‘value’ to predict, instead densities are estimated. This sub-chapter explains how to estimate probability distributions for continuous variables using the mlr3proba extension package. Spatiotemporal Analysis Spatiotemporal analysis data observations entail reference information about spatial and temporal characteristics. One of the largest issues of spatiotemporal data analysis is the inevitable presence of auto-correlation in the data. Auto-correlation is especially severe in data with marginal spatiotemporal variation. The sub-chapter on Spatiotemporal analysis provides instructions on how to account for spatiotemporal data. Ordinal Analysis This is work in progress. See mlr3ordinal for the current state. Functional Analysis Functional analysis contains data that consists of curves varying over a continuum e.g. time, frequency or wavelength. This type of analysis is frequently used when examining measurements over various time points. Steps on how to accommodate functional data structures in mlr3 are explained in the functional analysis sub-chapter. Multilabel Classification Multilabel classification deals with objects that can belong to more than one category at the same time. Numerous target labels are attributed to a single observation. Working with multilabel data requires one to use modified algorithms, to accommodate data specific characteristics. Two approaches to multilabel classification are prominently used: The problem transformation method The algorithm adaption method Instructions on how to deal with multilabel classification in mlr3 can be found in this sub-chapter. Cost Sensitive Classification This sub-chapter deals with the implementation of cost-sensitive classification. Regular classification aims to minimize the misclassification rate and thus all types of misclassification errors are deemed equally severe. Cost-sensitive classification is a setting where the costs caused by different kinds of errors are not assumed to be equal. The objective is to minimize the expected costs. Analytical data for a big credit institution is used as a use case to illustrate the different features. Firstly, the sub-chapter provides guidance on how to implement a first model. Subsequently, the sub-chapter contains instructions on how to modify cost sensitivity measures, thresholding and threshold tuning. "],["survival.html", "7.1 Survival Analysis", " 7.1 Survival Analysis Survival analysis is a sub-field of supervised machine learning in which the aim is to predict the survival distribution of a given individual. Arguably the main feature of survival analysis is that unlike classification and regression, learners are trained on two features: the time until the event takes place the event type: either censoring or death. At a particular time-point, an individual is either: alive, dead, or censored. Censoring occurs if it is unknown if an individual is alive or dead. For example, say we are interested in patients in hospital and every day it is recorded if they are alive or dead, then after a patient leaves it is unknown if they are alive or dead, hence they are censored. If there was no censoring, then ordinary regression analysis could be used instead. Furthermore, survival data contains solely positive values and therefore needs to be transformed to avoid biases. Note that survival analysis accounts for both censored and uncensored observations while adjusting respective model parameters. The package mlr3proba extends mlr3 with the following objects for survival analysis: TaskSurv to define (censored) survival tasks LearnerSurv as base class for survival learners PredictionSurv as specialized class for Prediction objects MeasureSurv as specialized class for performance measures For a good introduction to survival analysis see Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research (Collett 2014). 7.1.1 TaskSurv Unlike TaskClassif and TaskRegr which have a single ‘target’ argument, TaskSurv mimics the survival::Surv object and has three-four target arguments (dependent on censoring type) library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3proba&quot;) library(&quot;survival&quot;) TaskSurv$new(id = &quot;interval_censored&quot;, backend = survival::bladder2[,-c(1, 7)], time = &quot;start&quot;, time2 = &quot;stop&quot;, type = &quot;interval2&quot;) ## &lt;TaskSurv:interval_censored&gt; (178 x 6) ## * Target: start, stop ## * Properties: - ## * Features (4): ## - dbl (2): enum, rx ## - int (2): number, size # type = &quot;right&quot; is default task = TaskSurv$new(id = &quot;right_censored&quot;, backend = survival::rats, time = &quot;time&quot;, event = &quot;status&quot;, type = &quot;right&quot;) print(task) ## &lt;TaskSurv:right_censored&gt; (300 x 5) ## * Target: time, status ## * Properties: - ## * Features (3): ## - int (1): litter ## - dbl (1): rx ## - chr (1): sex # the target column is a survival object: head(task$truth()) ## [1] 101+ 49 104+ 91+ 104+ 102+ # kaplan-meier plot library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) autoplot(task) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;GGally&#39;: ## method from ## +.gg ggplot2 7.1.2 Predict Types - crank, lp, and distr Every PredictionSurv object can predict one or more of: lp - Linear predictor calculated as the fitted coefficients multiplied by the test data. distr - Predicted survival distribution, either discrete or continuous. Implemented in distr6. crank - Continuous risk ranking. lp and crank can be used with measures of discrimination such as the concordance index. Whilst lp is a specific mathematical prediction, crank is any continuous ranking that identifies who is more or less likely to experience the event. So far the only implemented learner that only returns a continuous ranking is surv.svm. If a PredictionSurv returns an lp then the crank is identical to this. Otherwise crank is calculated as the expectation of the predicted survival distribution. Note that for linear proportional hazards models, the ranking (but not necessarily the crank score itself) given by lp and the expectation of distr, is identical. The example below uses the rats task shipped with mlr3proba. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;rats&quot;) learn = lrn(&quot;surv.coxph&quot;) train_set = sample(task$nrow, 0.8 * task$nrow) test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train_set) learn$train(task, row_ids = train_set) prediction = learn$predict(task, row_ids = test_set) print(prediction) ## &lt;PredictionSurv&gt; for 60 observations: ## row_id time status crank lp distr ## 3 104 FALSE 0.8711 0.8711 &lt;VectorDistribution[60]&gt; ## 5 104 FALSE -2.5385 -2.5385 &lt;VectorDistribution[60]&gt; ## 6 102 FALSE -2.5385 -2.5385 &lt;VectorDistribution[60]&gt; ## --- ## 293 75 TRUE -1.5681 -1.5681 &lt;VectorDistribution[60]&gt; ## 296 104 FALSE 1.8617 1.8617 &lt;VectorDistribution[60]&gt; ## 300 102 FALSE -1.5479 -1.5479 &lt;VectorDistribution[60]&gt; 7.1.3 Composition Finally we take a look at the PipeOps implemented in mlr3proba, which are used for composition of predict types. For example, a predict linear predictor does not have a lot of meaning by itself, but it can be composed into a survival distribution.

References "],["density.html", "7.2 Density Estimation", " 7.2 Density Estimation Density estimation is the learning task to find the unknown distribution from which an i.i.d. data set is generated. We interpret this broadly, with this distribution not necessarily being continuous (so may possess a mass not density). The conditional case, where a distribution is predicted conditional on covariates, is known as ‘probabilistic supervised regression’, and will be implemented in mlr3proba in the near-future. Unconditional density estimation is viewed as an unsupervised task. For a good overview to density estimation see Density estimation for statistics and data analysis (Silverman 1986). The package mlr3proba extends mlr3 with the following objects for density estimation: TaskDens to define density tasks LearnerDens as base class for density estimators PredictionDens as specialized class for Prediction objects MeasureDens as specialized class for performance measures In this example we demonstrate the basic functionality of the package on the faithful data from the datasets package. This task ships as pre-defined TaskDens with mlr3proba. library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3proba&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;precip&quot;) print(task) ## &lt;TaskDens:precip&gt; (70 x 1) ## * Target: - ## * Properties: - ## * Features (1): ## - dbl (1): precip # histogram and density plot library(&quot;mlr3viz&quot;) autoplot(task, type = &quot;overlay&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Hence, TaskDens is an unsupervised task which inherits directly from Task unlike TaskClassif and TaskRegr. However, TaskDens still has a target argument and a $truth field defined by: target - the name of the variable in the data for which to estimate density $truth - the values of the target column (which is not the true density, which is always unknown) 7.2.1 Train and Predict Density learners have train and predict methods, though being unsupervised, ‘prediction’ is actually ‘estimation’. In training, a distr6 object is created, see here for full tutorials on how to access the probability density function, pdf, cumulative distribution function, cdf, and other important fields and methods. The predict method is simply a wrapper around self$model$pdf and if available self$model$cdf, i.e. evaluates the pdf/cdf at given points. Note that in prediction the points to evaluate the pdf and cdf are determined by the target column in the TaskDens object used for testing. # create task and learner task_faithful = TaskDens$new(id = &quot;eruptions&quot;, backend = datasets::faithful$eruptions) learner = lrn(&quot;dens.hist&quot;) # train/test split train_set = sample(task_faithful$nrow, 0.8 * task_faithful$nrow) test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task_faithful$nrow), train_set) # fitting KDE and model inspection learner$train(task_faithful, row_ids = train_set) learner$model ## $distr ## Histogram ## ## $hist ## $breaks ## [1] 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 ## ## $counts ## [1] 39 31 5 7 22 62 47 4 ## ## $density ## [1] 0.35945 0.28571 0.04608 0.06452 0.20276 0.57143 0.43318 0.03687 ## ## $mids ## [1] 1.75 2.25 2.75 3.25 3.75 4.25 4.75 5.25 ## ## $xname ## [1] &quot;dat&quot; ## ## $equidist ## [1] TRUE ## ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;histogram&quot; ## ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;dens.hist&quot; class(learner$model) ## [1] &quot;dens.hist&quot; # make predictions for new data prediction = learner$predict(task_faithful, row_ids = test_set) Every PredictionDens object can estimate: pdf - probability density function Some learners can estimate: cdf - cumulative distribution function 7.2.2 Benchmark Experiment Finally, we conduct a small benchmark study on the precip task using some of the integrated survival learners: # some integrated learners learners = lrns(c(&quot;dens.hist&quot;, &quot;dens.kde&quot;)) print(learners) ## [[1]] ## &lt;LearnerDensHistogram:dens.hist&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: list() ## * Packages: distr6 ## * Predict Type: pdf ## * Feature types: integer, numeric ## * Properties: - ## ## [[2]] ## &lt;LearnerDensKDE:dens.kde&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: kernel=Epan, bandwidth=silver ## * Packages: distr6 ## * Predict Type: pdf ## * Feature types: integer, numeric ## * Properties: missings # Logloss for probabilistic predictions measure = msr(&quot;dens.logloss&quot;) print(measure) ## &lt;MeasureDensLogloss:dens.logloss&gt; ## * Packages: - ## * Range: [0, Inf] ## * Minimize: TRUE ## * Properties: - ## * Predict type: pdf set.seed(1) bmr = benchmark(benchmark_grid(task, learners, rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3))) bmr$aggregate(measure) ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id iters dens.logloss ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; precip dens.hist cv 3 4.396 ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; precip dens.kde cv 3 4.818 autoplot(bmr, measure = measure) The results of this experiment show that the sophisticated Penalized Density Estimator does not outperform the baseline Histogram, but that the Kernel Density Estimator has at least consistently better (i.e. lower logloss) results. References "],["spatiotemporal.html", "7.3 Spatiotemporal Analysis", " 7.3 Spatiotemporal Analysis Data observations may entail reference information about spatial or temporal characteristics. Spatial information is stored as coordinates, usually named “x” and “y” or “lat”/“lon”. Treating spatiotemporal data using non-spatial data methods can lead to over-optimistic performance estimates. Hence, methods specifically designed to account for the special nature of spatiotemporal data are needed. In the mlr3 framework, the following packages relate to this field: mlr3spatiotemporal (biased-reduced performance estimation) mlr3forecasting (time-series support) mlr3raster (enhanced spatial prediction) The following (sub-)sections introduce the potential pitfalls of spatiotemporal data in machine learning and how to account for it. Note that not all functionality will be covered, and that some of the used packages are still in early lifecycles. If you want to contribute to one of the packages mentioned above, please contact Patrick Schratz. 7.3.1 Autocorrelation Data which includes spatial or temporal information requires special treatment in machine learning (similar to survival, ordinal and other task types listed in the special tasks chapter). In contrast to non-spatial/non-temporal data, observations inherit a natural grouping, either in space or time or in both space and time (Legendre 1993). This grouping causes observations to be autocorrelated, either in space (spatial autocorrelation (SAC)), time (temporal autocorrelation (TAC)) or both space and time (spatiotemporal autocorrelation (STAC)). For simplicity, the acronym STAC is used as a generic term in the following chapter for all the different characteristics introduced above. What effects does STAC have in statistical/machine learning? The overarching problem is that STAC violates the assumption that the observations in the train and test datasets are independent (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani 2001). If this assumption is violated, the reliability of the resulting performance estimates, for example retrieved via cross-validation, is decreased. The magnitude of this decrease is linked to the magnitude of STAC in the dataset, which cannot be determined easily. One approach to account for the existence of STAC is to use dedicated resampling methods. mlr3spatiotemporal provides access to the most frequently used spatiotemporal resampling methods. The following example showcases how a spatial dataset can be used to retrieve a bias-reduced performance estimate of a learner. The following examples use the ecuador dataset created by Jannes Muenchow. It contains information on the occurrence of landslides (binary) in the Andes of Southern Ecuador. The landslides were mapped from aerial photos taken in 2000. The dataset is well suited to serve as an example because it it relatively small and of course due to the spatial nature of the observations. Please refer to Muenchow, Brenning, and Richter (2012) for a detailed description of the dataset. To account for the spatial autocorrelation probably present in the landslide data, we will make use one of the most used spatial partitioning methods, a cluster-based k-means grouping (Brenning 2012), (\"spcv_coords\" in mlr3spatiotemporal). This method performs a clustering in 2D space which contrasts with the commonly used random partitioning for non-spatial data. The grouping has the effect that train and test data are more separated in space as they would be by conducting a random partitioning, thereby reducing the effect of STAC. By contrast, when using the classical random partitioning approach with spatial data, train and test observations would be located side-by-side across the full study area (a visual example is provided further below). This leads to a high similarity between train and test sets, resulting in “better” but biased performance estimates in every fold of a CV compared to the spatial CV approach. However, these low error rates are mainly caused due to the STAC in the observations and the lack of appropriate partitioning methods and not by the power of the fitted model. 7.3.2 Spatial CV vs. Non-Spatial CV In the following a spatial and a non-spatial CV will be conducted to showcase the mentioned performance differences. The performance of a simple classification tree (\"classif.rpart\") is evaluated on a random partitioning (\"repeated_cv\") with four folds and two repetitions. The chosen evaluation measure is “classification error” (\"classif.ce\"). The only difference in the spatial setting is that \"repeated_spcv_coords\" is chosen instead of \"repeated_cv\". 7.3.2.1 Non-Spatial CV library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3spatiotempcv&quot;) set.seed(42) # be less verbose lgr::get_logger(&quot;bbotk&quot;)$set_threshold(&quot;warn&quot;) lgr::get_logger(&quot;mlr3&quot;)$set_threshold(&quot;warn&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;ecuador&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, maxdepth = 3, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) resampling_nsp = rsmp(&quot;repeated_cv&quot;, folds = 4, repeats = 2) rr_nsp = resample( task = task, learner = learner, resampling = resampling_nsp) rr_nsp$aggregate(measures = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;)) ## classif.ce ## 0.3389 7.3.2.2 Spatial CV task = tsk(&quot;ecuador&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, maxdepth = 3, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) resampling_sp = rsmp(&quot;repeated_spcv_coords&quot;, folds = 4, repeats = 2) rr_sp = resample( task = task, learner = learner, resampling = resampling_sp) rr_sp$aggregate(measures = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;)) ## classif.ce ## 0.4125 Here, the classification tree learner is around 0.05 percentage points worse when using Spatial Cross-Validation (SpCV) compared to Non-Spatial Cross-Validation (NSpCV). The magnitude of this difference is variable as it depends on the dataset, the magnitude of STAC and the learner itself. For algorithms with a higher tendency of overfitting to the training set, the difference between the two methods will be larger. 7.3.2.3 Visualization of Spatiotemporal Partitions Every partitioning method in mlr3spatiotemporal comes with a generic plot() method to visualize the created groups. In a 2D space this happens via ggplot2 while for spatiotemporal methods 3D visualizations via plotly are created. autoplot(resampling_sp, task, fold_id = c(1:4)) * ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-3.97, -4, -0.01)) * ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-79.06, -79.08, -0.01)) ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). Unless specified by the user, the coordinate reference system (CRS) defaults to EPSG code 4326 (WGS84). This is because a lat/lon based CRS is better suited for plotting purposes than a Mercator (UTM) one. Note that setting the correct CRS for the given data during construction is very important. Even though EPSG 4326 is a good fallback and often used for visualization purposes, spatial offsets of up to multiple meters may occur if the wrong CRS was passed initially. This example used an already created task via the sugar function tsk(). In practice however, one needs to create a spatiotemporal task via TaskClassifST()/TaskRegrST() and set the crs argument. The spatial grouping of the k-means based approach above contrasts visually ver well compared to the NSpCV (random) partitioning: autoplot(resampling_nsp, task, fold_id = c(1:4)) * ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-3.97, -4, -0.01)) * ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-79.06, -79.08, -0.01)) ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). ## CRS not set, transforming to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326). 7.3.3 Choosing a Resampling Method While the example used the \"spcv_coords\" method, this does not mean that this method is the best or only method suitable for this task. Even though this method is quite popular, it was mainly chosen because of the clear visual grouping differences compared to random partitioning. In fact, most often multiple spatial partitioning methods can be used for a dataset. It is recommended (required) that users familiarize themselves with each implemented method and decide which method to choose based on the specific characteristics of the dataset. For almost all methods implemented in mlr3spatiotemporal, there is a scientific publication describing the strengths and weaknesses of the respective approach (either linked in the help file of mlr3spatiotemporal or its respective dependency packages). In the example above, a cross-validation without hyperparameter tuning was shown. If a nested CV is desired, it is recommended to use the same spatial partitioning method for the inner loop (= tuning level). See Schratz et al. (2019) for more details and chapter 11 of Geocomputation with R (Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow 2019)3. A list of all implemented methods in mlr3spatiotemporal can be found in the Getting Started vignette of the package. If you want to learn even more about the field of spatial partitioning, STAC and the problems associated with it, the work of Prof. Hanna Meyer is very much recommended for further reference.

"],["cost-sens.html", "7.7 Cost-Sensitive Classification", " 7.7 Cost-Sensitive Classification In regular classification the aim is to minimize the misclassification rate and thus all types of misclassification errors are deemed equally severe. A more general setting is cost-sensitive classification. Cost sensitive classification does not assume that the costs caused by different kinds of errors are equal. The objective of cost sensitive classification is to minimize the expected costs. Imagine you are an analyst for a big credit institution. Let’s also assume that a correct decision of the bank would result in 35% of the profit at the end of a specific period. A correct decision means that the bank predicts that a customer will pay their bills (hence would obtain a loan), and the customer indeed has good credit. On the other hand, a wrong decision means that the bank predicts that the customer’s credit is in good standing, but the opposite is true. This would result in a loss of 100% of the given loan. Good Customer (truth) Bad Customer (truth) Good Customer (predicted) + 0.35 - 1.0 Bad Customer (predicted) 0 0 Expressed as costs (instead of profit), we can write down the cost-matrix as follows: costs = matrix(c(-0.35, 0, 1, 0), nrow = 2) dimnames(costs) = list(response = c(&quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;), truth = c(&quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;)) print(costs) ## truth ## response good bad ## good -0.35 1 ## bad 0.00 0 An exemplary data set for such a problem is the German Credit task: library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) task = tsk(&quot;german_credit&quot;) table(task$truth()) ## ## good bad ## 700 300 The data has 70% customers who are able to pay back their credit, and 30% bad customers who default on the debt. A manager, who doesn’t have any model, could decide to give either everybody a credit or to give nobody a credit. The resulting costs for the German credit data are: # nobody: (700 * costs[2, 1] + 300 * costs[2, 2]) / 1000 ## [1] 0 # everybody (700 * costs[1, 1] + 300 * costs[1, 2]) / 1000 ## [1] 0.055 If the average loan is $20,000, the credit institute would lose more than one million dollar if it would grant everybody a credit: # average profit * average loan * number of customers 0.055 * 20000 * 1000 ## [1] 1100000 Our goal is to find a model which minimizes the costs (and thereby maximizes the expected profit). 7.7.1 A First Model For our first model, we choose an ordinary logistic regression (implemented in the add-on package mlr3learners). We first create a classification task, then resample the model using a 10-fold cross validation and extract the resulting confusion matrix: library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) learner = lrn(&quot;classif.log_reg&quot;) rr = resample(task, learner, rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;)) confusion = rr$prediction()$confusion print(confusion) ## truth ## response good bad ## good 609 152 ## bad 91 148 To calculate the average costs like above, we can simply multiply the elements of the confusion matrix with the elements of the previously introduced cost matrix, and sum the values of the resulting matrix: avg_costs = sum(confusion * costs) / 1000 print(avg_costs) ## [1] -0.06115 With an average loan of $20,000, the logistic regression yields the following costs: avg_costs * 20000 * 1000 ## [1] -1223000 Instead of losing over $1,000,000, the credit institute now can expect a profit of more than $1,000,000. 7.7.2 Cost-sensitive Measure Our natural next step would be to further improve the modeling step in order to maximize the profit. For this purpose we first create a cost-sensitive classification measure which calculates the costs based on our cost matrix. This allows us to conveniently quantify and compare modeling decisions. Fortunately, there already is a predefined measure Measure for this purpose: MeasureClassifCosts: cost_measure = msr(&quot;classif.costs&quot;, costs = costs) print(cost_measure) ## &lt;MeasureClassifCosts:classif.costs&gt; ## * Packages: - ## * Range: [-Inf, Inf] ## * Minimize: TRUE ## * Properties: requires_task ## * Predict type: response If we now call resample() or benchmark(), the cost-sensitive measures will be evaluated. We compare the logistic regression to a simple featureless learner and to a random forest from package ranger : learners = list( lrn(&quot;classif.log_reg&quot;), lrn(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;), lrn(&quot;classif.ranger&quot;) ) cv3 = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3) bmr = benchmark(benchmark_grid(task, learners, cv3)) bmr$aggregate(cost_measure) ## nr resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id ## 1: 1 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.log_reg cv ## 2: 2 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.featureless cv ## 3: 3 &lt;ResampleResult[21]&gt; german_credit classif.ranger cv ## iters classif.costs ## 1: 3 -0.05696 ## 2: 3 0.05498 ## 3: 3 -0.03822 As expected, the featureless learner is performing comparably bad. The logistic regression and the random forest work equally well. 7.7.3 Thresholding Although we now correctly evaluate the models in a cost-sensitive fashion, the models themselves are unaware of the classification costs. They assume the same costs for both wrong classification decisions (false positives and false negatives). Some learners natively support cost-sensitive classification (e.g., XXX). However, we will concentrate on a more generic approach which works for all models which can predict probabilities for class labels: thresholding. Most learners can calculate the probability \\(p\\) for the positive class. If \\(p\\) exceeds the threshold \\(0.5\\), they predict the positive class, and the negative class otherwise. For our binary classification case of the credit data, the we primarily want to minimize the errors where the model predicts “good”, but truth is “bad” (i.e., the number of false positives) as this is the more expensive error. If we now increase the threshold to values \\(&gt; 0.5\\), we reduce the number of false negatives. Note that we increase the number of false positives simultaneously, or, in other words, we are trading false positives for false negatives. # fit models with probability prediction learner = lrn(&quot;classif.log_reg&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) rr = resample(task, learner, rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;)) p = rr$prediction() print(p) ## &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 1000 observations: ## row_id truth response prob.good prob.bad ## 1 good good 0.9621 0.03793 ## 8 good good 0.6373 0.36265 ## 12 bad bad 0.1034 0.89664 ## --- ## 994 good bad 0.3088 0.69122 ## 998 good good 0.9320 0.06804 ## 1000 good good 0.8279 0.17210 # helper function to try different threshold values interactively with_threshold = function(p, th) { p$set_threshold(th) list(confusion = p$confusion, costs = p$score(measures = cost_measure, task = task)) } with_threshold(p, 0.5) ## $confusion ## truth ## response good bad ## good 604 145 ## bad 96 155 ## ## $costs ## classif.costs ## -0.0664 with_threshold(p, 0.75) ## $confusion ## truth ## response good bad ## good 470 80 ## bad 230 220 ## ## $costs ## classif.costs ## -0.0845 with_threshold(p, 1.0) ## $confusion ## truth ## response good bad ## good 0 1 ## bad 700 299 ## ## $costs ## classif.costs ## 0.001 # TODO: include plot of threshold vs performance Instead of manually trying different threshold values, one uses use optimize() to find a good threshold value w.r.t. our performance measure: # simple wrapper function which takes a threshold and returns the resulting model performance # this wrapper is passed to optimize() to find its minimum for thresholds in [0.5, 1] f = function(th) { with_threshold(p, th)$costs } best = optimize(f, c(0.5, 1)) print(best) ## $minimum ## [1] 0.7295 ## ## $objective ## classif.costs ## -0.08645 # optimized confusion matrix: with_threshold(p, best$minimum)$confusion ## truth ## response good bad ## good 487 84 ## bad 213 216 Note that the function optimize() is intended for unimodal functions and therefore may converge to a local optimum here. See below for better alternatives to find good threshold values. 7.7.4 Threshold Tuning Before we start, we have load all required packages: library(mlr3) library(mlr3pipelines) library(mlr3tuning) 7.7.5 Adjusting thresholds: Two strategies Currently mlr3pipelines offers two main strategies towards adjusting classification thresholds. We can either expose the thresholds as a hyperparameter of the Learner by using PipeOpThreshold. This allows us to tune the thresholds via an outisde optimizer from mlr3tuning. Alternatively, we can also use PipeOpTuneThreshold which automatically tunes the threshold after each learner is fit. In this blog-post, we’ll go through both strategies. 7.7.6 PipeOpThreshold PipeOpThreshold can be put directly after a Learner. A simple example would be: gr = lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% po(&quot;threshold&quot;) l = GraphLearner$new(gr) Note, that predict_type = “prob” is required for po(\"threshold\") to have any effect. The thresholds are now exposed as a hyperparameter of the GraphLearner we created: l$param_set ## &lt;ParamSetCollection&gt; ## id class lower upper levels ## 1: classif.rpart.minsplit ParamInt 1 Inf ## 2: classif.rpart.minbucket ParamInt 1 Inf ## 3: classif.rpart.cp ParamDbl 0 1 ## 4: classif.rpart.maxcompete ParamInt 0 Inf ## 5: classif.rpart.maxsurrogate ParamInt 0 Inf ## 6: classif.rpart.maxdepth ParamInt 1 30 ## 7: classif.rpart.usesurrogate ParamInt 0 2 ## 8: classif.rpart.surrogatestyle ParamInt 0 1 ## 9: classif.rpart.xval ParamInt 0 Inf ## 10: classif.rpart.keep_model ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE ## 11: threshold.thresholds ParamUty NA NA ## default value ## 1: 20 ## 2: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 3: 0.01 ## 4: 4 ## 5: 5 ## 6: 30 ## 7: 2 ## 8: 0 ## 9: 10 0 ## 10: FALSE ## 11: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; 0.5 We can now tune those thresholds fom the outside as follows: Before tuning, we have to define which hyperparameters we want to tune over. In this example, we only tune over the thresholds parameter of the threshold pipeop. you can easily imagine, that we can also jointly tune over additional hyperparameters, i.e. rpart’s cp parameter. As the Task we aim to optimize for is a binary task, we can simply specify the threshold param: library(paradox) ps = ParamSet$new(list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;threshold.thresholds&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 1) )) We now create a AutoTuner, which automatically tunes the supplied learner over the ParamSet we supplied above. at = AutoTuner$new( learner = l, resampling = rsmp(&quot;cv&quot;, folds = 3L), measure = msr(&quot;classif.ce&quot;), search_space = ps, terminator = trm(&quot;evals&quot;, n_evals = 5L), tuner = TunerRandomSearch$new() ) at$train(tsk(&quot;german_credit&quot;)) ## INFO [19:30:02.012] Starting to optimize 1 parameter(s) with &#39;&lt;OptimizerRandomSearch&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;TerminatorEvals&gt;&#39; ## INFO [19:30:02.062] Evaluating 1 configuration(s) ## INFO [19:30:02.438] Result of batch 1: ## INFO [19:30:02.441] threshold.thresholds classif.ce uhash ## INFO [19:30:02.441] 0.1727 0.307 33bb405a-4d8c-492b-8071-2116e12af1d0 ## INFO [19:30:02.445] Evaluating 1 configuration(s) ## INFO [19:30:02.771] Result of batch 2: ## INFO [19:30:02.773] threshold.thresholds classif.ce uhash ## INFO [19:30:02.773] 0.7816 0.32 3981e67a-42ab-4e60-9a1d-87685c9c613f ## INFO [19:30:02.777] Evaluating 1 configuration(s) ## INFO [19:30:03.101] Result of batch 3: ## INFO [19:30:03.103] threshold.thresholds classif.ce uhash ## INFO [19:30:03.103] 0.3378 0.291 e9810c7b-2b56-4851-af80-82a3d4abc76b ## INFO [19:30:03.107] Evaluating 1 configuration(s) ## INFO [19:30:03.429] Result of batch 4: ## INFO [19:30:03.431] threshold.thresholds classif.ce uhash ## INFO [19:30:03.431] 0.2091 0.3 7a8f9de3-da97-4823-b27a-68c17a3ea81b ## INFO [19:30:03.435] Evaluating 1 configuration(s) ## INFO [19:30:03.754] Result of batch 5: ## INFO [19:30:03.756] threshold.thresholds classif.ce uhash ## INFO [19:30:03.756] 0.07717 0.3 197ff6af-c0a3-4ff9-85f6-b7d2e2f83d6b ## INFO [19:30:03.773] Finished optimizing after 5 evaluation(s) ## INFO [19:30:03.774] Result: ## INFO [19:30:03.776] threshold.thresholds learner_param_vals x_domain classif.ce ## INFO [19:30:03.776] 0.3378 &lt;list[2]&gt; &lt;list[1]&gt; 0.291 Inside the trafo, we simply collect all set params into a named vector via map_dbl and store it in the threshold.thresholds slot expected by the learner. Again, we create a AutoTuner, which automatically tunes the supplied learner over the ParamSet we supplied above. One drawback of this strategy is, that this requires us to fit a new model for each new threshold setting. While setting a threshold and computing performance is relatively cheap, fitting the learner is often more computationally demanding. A better strategy is therefore often to optimize the thresholds separately after each model fit. 7.7.7 PipeOpTunethreshold PipeOpTuneThreshold on the other hand works together with PipeOpLearnerCV. It directly optimizes the cross-validated predictions made by this PipeOp. This is done in order to avoid over-fitting the threshold tuning. A simple example would be: gr = po(&quot;learner_cv&quot;, lrn(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;)) %&gt;&gt;% po(&quot;tunethreshold&quot;) l2 = GraphLearner$new(gr) Note, that predict_type = “prob” is required for po(\"tunethreshold\") to work. Additionally, note that this time no threshold parameter is exposed, it is automatically tuned internally. l2$param_set ## &lt;ParamSetCollection&gt; ## id class lower upper levels ## 1: classif.rpart.resampling.method ParamFct NA NA cv,insample ## 2: classif.rpart.resampling.folds ParamInt 2 Inf ## 3: classif.rpart.resampling.keep_response ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE ## 4: classif.rpart.minsplit ParamInt 1 Inf ## 5: classif.rpart.minbucket ParamInt 1 Inf ## 6: classif.rpart.cp ParamDbl 0 1 ## 7: classif.rpart.maxcompete ParamInt 0 Inf ## 8: classif.rpart.maxsurrogate ParamInt 0 Inf ## 9: classif.rpart.maxdepth ParamInt 1 30 ## 10: classif.rpart.usesurrogate ParamInt 0 2 ## 11: classif.rpart.surrogatestyle ParamInt 0 1 ## 12: classif.rpart.xval ParamInt 0 Inf ## 13: classif.rpart.keep_model ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE ## 14: classif.rpart.affect_columns ParamUty NA NA ## 15: tunethreshold.measure ParamUty NA NA ## 16: tunethreshold.optimizer ParamUty NA NA ## 17: tunethreshold.log_level ParamUty NA NA ## default value ## 1: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; cv ## 2: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; 3 ## 3: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; FALSE ## 4: 20 ## 5: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; ## 6: 0.01 ## 7: 4 ## 8: 5 ## 9: 30 ## 10: 2 ## 11: 0 ## 12: 10 0 ## 13: FALSE ## 14: &lt;Selector[1]&gt; ## 15: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; classif.ce ## 16: &lt;NoDefault[3]&gt; gensa ## 17: &lt;function[1]&gt; warn Note that we can set rsmp(\"intask\") as a resampling strategy for “learner_cv” in order to evaluate predictions on the “training” data. This is generally not advised, as it might lead to over-fitting on the thresholds but can significantlty reduce runtime. For more information, see the post on Threshold Tuning on the mlr3 gallery. "],["interpretation.html", "8 Model Interpretation", " 8 Model Interpretation In principle, all generic frameworks for model interpretation are applicable on the models fitted with mlr3 by just extracting the fitted models from the Learner objects. However, two of the most popular frameworks, iml in Subsection @ref{iml}, DALEX in Subsection 8.2, and additionally come with some convenience for mlr3. "],["iml.html", "8.1 IML", " 8.1 IML Author: Shawn Storm iml is an R package that interprets the behavior and explains predictions of machine learning models. The functions provided in the iml package are model-agnostic which gives the flexibility to use any machine learning model. This chapter provides examples of how to use iml with mlr3. For more information refer to the IML github and the IML book 8.1.1 Penguin Task To understand what iml can offer, we start off with a thorough example. The goal of this example is to figure out the species of penguins given a set of features. The mlr3data::penguins data set from package mlr3data will be used which is an alternative to the iris data set. The penguins data sets contains 8 variables of 344 penguins: data(&quot;penguins&quot;, package = &quot;mlr3data&quot;) str(penguins) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 344 obs. of 8 variables: ## $ species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Adelie&quot;,&quot;Chinstrap&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ island : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Biscoe&quot;,&quot;Dream&quot;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... ## $ bill_length : num 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ... ## $ bill_depth : num 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ... ## $ flipper_length: int 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ... ## $ body_mass : int 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ... ## $ sex : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;: 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ... ## $ year : int 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ... To get started run: library(&quot;iml&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) set.seed(1) penguins = na.omit(penguins) task_peng = TaskClassif$new(id = &quot;Species&quot;, backend = penguins, target = &quot;species&quot;) penguins = na.omit(penguins) is to omit the 11 cases with missing values. If not omitted, there will be an error when running the learner from the data points that have N/A for some features. learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.ranger&quot;) learner$predict_type = &quot;prob&quot; learner$train(task_peng) learner$model ## Ranger result ## ## Call: ## ranger::ranger(dependent.variable.name = task$target_names, data = task$data(), probability = self$predict_type == &quot;prob&quot;, case.weights = task$weights$weight) ## ## Type: Probability estimation ## Number of trees: 500 ## Sample size: 333 ## Number of independent variables: 7 ## Mtry: 2 ## Target node size: 10 ## Variable importance mode: none ## Splitrule: gini ## OOB prediction error (Brier s.): 0.0179 x = penguins[which(names(penguins) != &quot;species&quot;)] model = Predictor$new(learner, data = x, y = penguins$species) As explained in Section 2.3, specific learners can be queried with mlr_learners. In Section 2.5 it is recommended for some classifiers to use the predict_type as prob instead of directly predicting a label. This is what is done in this example. penguins[which(names(penguins) != \"species\")] is the data of all the features and y will be the penguinsspecies. learner$train(task_peng) trains the model and learner$model stores the model from the training command. Predictor holds the machine learning model and the data. All interpretation methods in iml need the machine learning model and the data to be wrapped in the Predictor object. Next is the core functionality of iml. In this example three separate interpretation methods will be used: FeatureEffects, FeatureImp and Shapley FeatureEffects computes the effects for all given features on the model prediction. Different methods are implemented: Accumulated Local Effect (ALE) plots, Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. Shapley computes feature contributions for single predictions with the Shapley value – an approach from cooperative game theory (Shapley Value). FeatureImp computes the importance of features by calculating the increase in the model’s prediction error after permuting the feature (more here). 8.1.2 FeatureEffects In addition to the commands above the following two need to be ran: effect = FeatureEffects$new(model) plot(effect, features = c(&quot;bill_length&quot;, &quot;bill_depth&quot;, &quot;flipper_length&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) Figure 8.1: Plot of the results from FeatureEffects. FeatureEffects computes and plots feature effects of prediction models effect stores the object from the FeatureEffect computation and the results can then be plotted. In this example, all of the features provided by the penguins data set were used. All features except for year provide meaningful interpretable information. It should be clear why year doesn’t provide anything of significance. bill_length shows for example that when the bill length is smaller than roughly 40mm, there is a high chance that the penguin is an Adelie. 8.1.3 Shapley x = penguins[which(names(penguins) != &quot;species&quot;)] model = Predictor$new(learner, data = penguins, y = &quot;species&quot;) x.interest = data.frame(penguins[1, ]) shapley = Shapley$new(model, x.interest = x.interest) plot(shapley) Figure 8.2: Plot of the results from Shapley. \\(\\phi\\) gives the increase or decrease in probabilty given the values on the vertical axis The \\(\\phi\\) provides insight into the probability given the values on the vertical axis. For example, a penguin is less likely to be Gentoo if the bill_depth=18.7 is and much more likely to be Adelie than Chinstrap. 8.1.4 FeatureImp effect = FeatureImp$new(model, loss = &quot;ce&quot;) effect$plot(features = c(&quot;bill_length&quot;,&quot;bill_depth&quot;, &quot;flipper_length&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;,&quot;year&quot;)) Figure 8.3: Plot of the results from FeatureImp. FeatureImp visualizes the importance of features given the prediction model FeatureImp shows the level of importance of the features when classifying the penguins. It is clear to see that the bill_length is of high importance and one should concentrate on different boundaries of this feature when attempting to classify the three species. 8.1.5 Independent Test Data It is also interesting to see how well the model performs on a test data set. For this section, exactly as was recommended in Section 2.4, 80% of the penguin data set will be used for the training set and 20% for the test set: train_set = sample(task_peng$nrow, 0.8 * task_peng$nrow) test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task_peng$nrow), train_set) learner$train(task_peng, row_ids = train_set) prediction = learner$predict(task_peng, row_ids = test_set) First, we compare the feature importance on training and test set # plot on training model = Predictor$new(learner, data = penguins[train_set,], y = &quot;species&quot;) effect = FeatureImp$new(model, loss = &quot;ce&quot; ) plot_train = plot(effect, features = c(&quot;bill_length&quot;, &quot;bill_depth&quot;, &quot;flipper_length&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) # plot on test data model = Predictor$new(learner, data = penguins[test_set, ], y = &quot;species&quot;) effect = FeatureImp$new(model, loss = &quot;ce&quot; ) plot_test = plot(effect, features = c(&quot;bill_length&quot;, &quot;bill_depth&quot;, &quot;flipper_length&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) # combine into single plot library(patchwork) plot_train + plot_test Figure 8.4: FeatImp on train (left) and test (right) The results of the train set for FeatureImp are very similar, which is expected. We follow a similar approach to compare the feature effects: model = Predictor$new(learner, data = penguins[train_set,], y = &quot;species&quot;) effect = FeatureEffects$new(model) plot(effect, features = c(&quot;bill_length&quot;, &quot;bill_depth&quot;, &quot;flipper_length&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) Figure 8.5: FeatEffect train data set model = Predictor$new(learner, data = penguins[test_set,], y = &quot;species&quot;) effect = FeatureEffects$new(model) plot(effect, features = c(&quot;bill_length&quot;, &quot;bill_depth&quot;, &quot;flipper_length&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;body_mass&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) Figure 8.6: FeatEffect test data set As is the case with FeatureImp, the test data results show either an over- or underestimate of feature importance / feature effects compared to the results where the entire penguin data set was used. This would be a good opportunity for the reader to attempt to resolve the estimation by playing with the amount of features and the amount of data used for both the test and train data sets of FeatureImp and FeatureEffects. Be sure to not change the line train_set = sample(task_peng$nrow, 0.8 * task_peng$nrow) as it will randomly sample the data again.

The package implements a collection of methods for Explanatory Model Analysis. It is based on a unified grammar summarised in Figure ??. In the following sections, we will present subsequent methods available in the DALEX package based on a random forest model trained for football players worth prediction on the FIFA 20 data. We will show both methods analyzing the model at the level of a single prediction and the global level - for the whole data set. The structure of this chapter is the following: In Section 8.2.2 we introduce the FIFA 20 dataset and then in section 8.2.3 we train a random regression forest using the ranger package. Section 8.2.4 introduces general logic beyond DALEX explainers. Section 8.2.5 introduces methods for dataset level model exploration. Section 8.2.6 introduces methods for instance-level model exploration. Figure 8.7: Taxonomy of methods for model exploration presented in this chapter.

We will use the data scrapped from the sofifa website. The raw data is available at kaggle. After some basic data cleaning, the processed data for the top 5000 football players is available in the DALEX package under the name fifa. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) fifa[1:2,c(&quot;value_eur&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;height_cm&quot;, &quot;nationality&quot;, &quot;attacking_crossing&quot;)] ## value_eur age height_cm nationality attacking_crossing ## L.

One of the features, called value_eur, is the worth of the footballer in euros. In the next section, we will build a prediction model, which will estimate the worth of the player based on other player characteristics.

Examples of how this package works are shown on a random forest model implemented in the ranger package. We use the mlr3 package to build a predictive model. First, let’s load the required packages. library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) Then we can define the regression task - prediction of the value_eur variable: fifa_task &lt;- TaskRegr$new(id = &quot;fifa&quot;, backend = fifa, target = &quot;value_eur&quot;) Finally, we train mlr3’s ranger learner with 250 trees. Note that in this example for brevity we do not split the data into a train/test data. The model is built on the whole data. fifa_ranger &lt;- lrn(&quot;regr.ranger&quot;) fifa_ranger$param_set$values &lt;- list(num.trees = 250) fifa_ranger$train(fifa_task) fifa_ranger ## &lt;LearnerRegrRanger:regr.ranger&gt; ## * Model: ranger ## * Parameters: num.trees=250 ## * Packages: ranger ## * Predict Type: response ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, oob_error, weights 8.2.4 The general workflow Working with explanations in the DALEX package always consists of three steps schematically shown in the pipe below. model %&gt;% explain_mlr3(data = ..., y = ..., label = ...) %&gt;% model_parts() %&gt;% plot() All functions in the DALEX package can work for models with any structure. It is possible because in the first step we create an adapter that allows the downstream functions to access the model in a consistent fashion. In general, such an adapter is created with DALEX::explain() function, but for models created in the mlr3 package it is more convenient to use the DALEXtra::explain_mlr3(). Explanations are determined by the functions DALEX::model_parts(), DALEX::model_profile(), DALEX::predict_parts() and DALEX::predict_profile(). Each of these functions takes the model adapter as its first argument. The other arguments describe how the function works. We will present them in the following section. Explanations can be visualized with the generic function plot or summarised with the generic function print(). Each explanation is a data frame with an additional class attribute. The plot function creates graphs using the ggplot2 package, so they can be easily modified with usual ggplot2 decorators. We show this cascade of functions based on the FIFA example. To get started with the exploration of the model behaviour we need to create an explainer. DALEX::explain function handles is for all types of predictive models. In the DALEXtra package there generic versions for the most common ML frameworks. Among them the DALEXtra::explain_mlr3() function works for mlr3 models. This function performs a series of internal checks so the output is a bit verbose. Turn the verbose = FALSE argument to make it less wordy. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;DALEXtra&quot;) ranger_exp &lt;- explain_mlr3(fifa_ranger, data = fifa, y = fifa$value_eur, label = &quot;Ranger RF&quot;, colorize = FALSE) ## Preparation of a new explainer is initiated ## -&gt; model label : Ranger RF ## -&gt; data : 5000 rows 38 cols ## -&gt; target variable : 5000 values ## -&gt; predict function : yhat.LearnerRegr will be used ( default ) ## -&gt; predicted values : numerical, min = 457550 , mean = 7476877 , max = 89567933 ## -&gt; model_info : package mlr3 , ver. 0.8.0 , task regression ( default ) ## -&gt; residual function : difference between y and yhat ( default ) ## -&gt; residuals : numerical, min = -8250807 , mean = -3590 , max = 18161720 ## A new explainer has been created! 8.2.5 Dataset level exploration The DALEX::model_parts() function calculates the importance of variables using the permutations based importance. fifa_vi &lt;- model_parts(ranger_exp) head(fifa_vi) ## variable mean_dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 1409144 Ranger RF ## 2 value_eur 1409144 Ranger RF ## 3 height_cm 1473792 Ranger RF ## 4 mentality_aggression 1474980 Ranger RF ## 5 goalkeeping_kicking 1477404 Ranger RF ## 6 weight_kg 1480144 Ranger RF Results can be visualized with generic plot(). The chart for all 38 variables would be unreadable, so with the max_vars argument, we limit the number of variables on the plot. plot(fifa_vi, max_vars = 12, show_boxplots = FALSE) Once we know which variables are most important, we can use Partial Dependence Plots to show how the model, on average, changes with changes in selected variables. In this example, they show the average relation between the particular variables and players’ value. selected_variables &lt;- c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;movement_reactions&quot;, &quot;skill_ball_control&quot;, &quot;skill_dribbling&quot;) fifa_pd &lt;- model_profile(ranger_exp, variables = selected_variables)$agr_profiles fifa_pd ## Top profiles : ## _vname_ _label_ _x_ _yhat_ _ids_ ## 1 skill_ball_control Ranger RF 5 6916332 0 ## 2 skill_dribbling Ranger RF 7 7260242 0 ## 3 skill_dribbling Ranger RF 11 7257083 0 ## 4 skill_dribbling Ranger RF 12 7257878 0 ## 5 skill_dribbling Ranger RF 13 7257148 0 ## 6 skill_dribbling Ranger RF 14 7254878 0 Again, the result of the explanation can be presented with the generic function plot(). library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(fifa_pd) + scale_y_continuous(&quot;Estimated value in Euro&quot;, labels = scales::dollar_format(suffix = &quot;€&quot;, prefix = &quot;&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Partial Dependence profiles for selected variables&quot;) The general trend for most player characteristics is the same. The higher are the skills the higher is the player’s worth. With a single exception – variable Age. 8.2.6 Instance level explanation Time to see how the model behaves for a single observation/player This can be done for any player, but this example we will use the Cristiano Ronaldo. The function predict_parts is an instance-level version of the model_parts function introduced in the previous section. For the background behind that method see the Introduction to Break Down. ronaldo &lt;- fifa[&quot;Cristiano Ronaldo&quot;,] ronaldo_bd_ranger &lt;- predict_parts(ranger_exp, new_observation = ronaldo) head(ronaldo_bd_ranger) ## contribution ## Ranger RF: intercept 7476877 ## Ranger RF: movement_reactions = 96 13474528 ## Ranger RF: skill_ball_control = 92 6151314 ## Ranger RF: attacking_finishing = 94 4216791 ## Ranger RF: mentality_positioning = 95 5625554 ## Ranger RF: attacking_short_passing = 83 4872206 The generic plot() function shows the estimated contribution of variables to the final prediction. Cristiano is a striker, therefore characteristics that influence his worth are those related to attack, like attacking_volleys or skill_dribbling. The only variable with negative attribution is age. plot(ronaldo_bd_ranger) Another way to inspect the local behaviour of the model is to use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). It locally shows the contribution of variables to a single observation, just like Break Down. ronaldo_shap_ranger &lt;- predict_parts(ranger_exp, new_observation = ronaldo, type = &quot;shap&quot;) plot(ronaldo_shap_ranger) + scale_y_continuous(&quot;Estimated value in Euro&quot;, labels = scales::dollar_format(suffix = &quot;€&quot;, prefix = &quot;&quot;)) In the previous section, we’ve introduced a global explanation - Partial Dependence Plots. Ceteris Paribus is the instance level version of that plot. It shows the response of the model for observation when we change only one variable while others stay unchanged.

Before diving deeper, we give a short introduction to PipeOps. 9.5.1 An introduction to “PipeOp”s In this example, we create a linear Pipeline. After scaling all input features, we rotate our data using principal component analysis. After this transformation, we use a simple Decision Tree learner for classification. As exemplary data, we will use the “iris” classification task. This object contains the famous iris dataset and some meta-information, such as the target variable. library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) We quickly split our data into a train and a test set: test.idx = sample(seq_len(task$nrow), 30) train.idx = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), test.idx) # Set task to only use train indexes task$row_roles$use = train.idx A Pipeline (or Graph) contains multiple pipeline operators (“PipeOp”s), where each PipeOp transforms the data when it flows through it. For this use case, we require 3 transformations: A PipeOp that scales the data A PipeOp that performs PCA A PipeOp that contains the Decision Tree learner A list of available PipeOps can be obtained from library(&quot;mlr3pipelines&quot;) mlr_pipeops$keys() ## [1] &quot;boxcox&quot; &quot;branch&quot; &quot;chunk&quot; ## [4] &quot;classbalancing&quot; &quot;classifavg&quot; &quot;classweights&quot; ## [7] &quot;colapply&quot; &quot;collapsefactors&quot; &quot;colroles&quot; ## [10] &quot;copy&quot; &quot;datefeatures&quot; &quot;encode&quot; ## [13] &quot;encodeimpact&quot; &quot;encodelmer&quot; &quot;featureunion&quot; ## [16] &quot;filter&quot; &quot;fixfactors&quot; &quot;histbin&quot; ## [19] &quot;ica&quot; &quot;imputeconstant&quot; &quot;imputehist&quot; ## [22] &quot;imputelearner&quot; &quot;imputemean&quot; &quot;imputemedian&quot; ## [25] &quot;imputemode&quot; &quot;imputeoor&quot; &quot;imputesample&quot; ## [28] &quot;kernelpca&quot; &quot;learner&quot; &quot;learner_cv&quot; ## [31] &quot;missind&quot; &quot;modelmatrix&quot; &quot;multiplicityexply&quot; ## [34] &quot;multiplicityimply&quot; &quot;mutate&quot; &quot;nmf&quot; ## [37] &quot;nop&quot; &quot;ovrsplit&quot; &quot;ovrunite&quot; ## [40] &quot;pca&quot; &quot;proxy&quot; &quot;quantilebin&quot; ## [43] &quot;randomprojection&quot; &quot;randomresponse&quot; &quot;regravg&quot; ## [46] &quot;removeconstants&quot; &quot;renamecolumns&quot; &quot;replicate&quot; ## [49] &quot;scale&quot; &quot;scalemaxabs&quot; &quot;scalerange&quot; ## [52] &quot;select&quot; &quot;smote&quot; &quot;spatialsign&quot; ## [55] &quot;subsample&quot; &quot;targetinvert&quot; &quot;targetmutate&quot; ## [58] &quot;targettrafoscalerange&quot; &quot;textvectorizer&quot; &quot;threshold&quot; ## [61] &quot;tunethreshold&quot; &quot;unbranch&quot; &quot;vtreat&quot; ## [64] &quot;yeojohnson&quot; First we define the required PipeOps: op1 = PipeOpScale$new() op2 = PipeOpPCA$new() op3 = PipeOpLearner$new(learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) 9.5.1.1 A quick glance into a PipeOp In order to get a better understanding of what the respective PipeOps do, we quickly look at one of them in detail: The most important slots in a PipeOp are: $train(): A function used to train the PipeOp. $predict(): A function used to predict with the PipeOp. The $train() and $predict() functions define the core functionality of our PipeOp. In many cases, in order to not leak information from the training set into the test set it is imperative to treat train and test data separately. For this we require a $train() function that learns the appropriate transformations from the training set and a $predict() function that applies the transformation on future data. In the case of PipeOpPCA this means the following: $train() learns a rotation matrix from its input and saves this matrix to an additional slot, $state. It returns the rotated input data stored in a new Task. $predict() uses the rotation matrix stored in $state in order to rotate future, unseen data. It returns those in a new Task. 9.5.1.2 Constructing the Pipeline We can now connect the PipeOps constructed earlier to a Pipeline. We can do this using the %&gt;&gt;% operator. linear_pipeline = op1 %&gt;&gt;% op2 %&gt;&gt;% op3 The result of this operation is a “Graph”. A Graph connects the input and output of each PipeOp to the following PipeOp. This allows us to specify linear processing pipelines. In this case, we connect the output of the scaling PipeOp to the input of the PCA PipeOp and the output of the PCA PipeOp to the input of PipeOpLearner. We can now train the Graph using the iris Task. linear_pipeline$train(task) ## $classif.rpart.output ## NULL When we now train the graph, the data flows through the graph as follows: The Task flows into the PipeOpScale. The PipeOp scales each column in the data contained in the Task and returns a new Task that contains the scaled data to its output. The scaled Task flows into the PipeOpPCA. PCA transforms the data and returns a (possibly smaller) Task, that contains the transformed data. This transformed data then flows into the learner, in our case classif.rpart. It is then used to train the learner, and as a result saves a model that can be used to predict new data. In order to predict on new data, we need to save the relevant transformations our data went through while training. As a result, each PipeOp saves a state, where information required to appropriately transform future data is stored. In our case, this is mean and standard deviation of each column for PipeOpScale, the PCA rotation matrix for PipeOpPCA and the learned model for PipeOpLearner. # predict on test.idx task$row_roles$use = test.idx linear_pipeline$predict(task) ## $classif.rpart.output ## &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 30 observations: ## row_id truth response ## 123 virginica virginica ## 18 setosa setosa ## 96 versicolor versicolor ## --- ## 126 virginica virginica ## 118 virginica virginica ## 19 setosa setosa 9.5.2 mlr3pipelines vs. mlr In order to showcase the benefits of mlr3pipelines over mlr’s Wrapper mechanism, we compare the case of imputing missing values before filtering the top 2 features and then applying a learner. While mlr wrappers are generally less verbose and require a little less code, this heavily inhibits flexibility. As an example, wrappers can generally not process data in parallel. 9.5.2.1 mlr library(&quot;mlr&quot;) # We first create a learner lrn = makeLearner(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) # Wrap this learner in a FilterWrapper lrn.wrp = makeFilterWrapper(lrn, fw.abs = 2L) # And wrap the resulting wrapped learner into an ImputeWrapper. lrn.wrp = makeImputeWrapper(lrn.wrp) # Afterwards, we can train the resulting learner on a task train(lrn, iris.task) 9.5.2.2 mlr3pipelines library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3pipelines&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3filters&quot;) impute = PipeOpImpute$new() filter = PipeOpFilter$new(filter = FilterVariance$new(), param_vals = list(filter.nfeat = 2L)) rpart = PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) # Assemble the Pipeline pipeline = impute %&gt;&gt;% filter %&gt;&gt;% rpart # And convert to a &#39;GraphLearner&#39; learner = GraphLearner$new(id = &quot;Pipeline&quot;, pipeline) The fact that mlr’s wrappers have to be applied inside-out, i.e. in the reverse order is often confusing. This is way more straight-forward in mlr3pipelines, where we simply chain the different methods using %&gt;&gt;%. Additionally, mlr3pipelines offers way greater possibilities with respect to the kinds of Pipelines that can be constructed. In mlr3pipelines, we allow for the construction of parallel and conditional pipelines. This was previously not possible. 9.5.3 mlr3pipelines vs. sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline In order to broaden the horizon, we compare to Python sklearn’s Pipeline methods. sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline sequentially applies a list of transforms before fitting a final estimator. Intermediate steps of the pipeline are transforms, i.e. steps that can learn from the data, but also transform the data while it flows through it. The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated together while setting different parameters. For this, it enables setting parameters of the various steps. It is thus conceptually very similar to mlr3pipelines. Similarly to mlr3pipelines, we can tune over a full Pipeline using various tuning methods. Pipeline mainly supports linear pipelines. This means, that it can execute parallel steps, such as for example Bagging, but it does not support conditional execution, i.e. PipeOpBranch. At the same time, the different transforms in the pipeline can be cached, which makes tuning over the configuration space of a Pipeline more efficient, as executing some steps multiple times can be avoided. We compare functionality available in both mlr3pipelines and sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline to give a comparison. The following example obtained from the sklearn documentation showcases a Pipeline that first Selects a feature and performs PCA on the original data, concatenates the resulting datasets and applies a Support Vector Machine. 9.5.3.1 sklearn from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline, FeatureUnion from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.datasets import load_iris from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest iris = load_iris() X, y = iris.data, iris.target # This dataset is way too high-dimensional. Better do PCA: pca = PCA(n_components=2) # Maybe some original features where good, too? selection = SelectKBest(k=1) # Build estimator from PCA and Univariate selection: combined_features = FeatureUnion([(&quot;pca&quot;, pca), (&quot;univ_select&quot;, selection)]) # Use combined features to transform dataset: X_features = combined_features.fit(X, y).transform(X) svm = SVC(kernel=&quot;linear&quot;) # Do grid search over k, n_components and C: pipeline = Pipeline([(&quot;features&quot;, combined_features), (&quot;svm&quot;, svm)]) param_grid = dict(features__pca__n_components=[1, 2, 3], features__univ_select__k=[1, 2], svm__C=[0.1, 1, 10]) grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, verbose=10) grid_search.fit(X, y) 9.5.3.2 mlr3pipelines library(&quot;mlr3verse&quot;) iris = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) # Build the steps copy = PipeOpCopy$new(2) pca = PipeOpPCA$new() selection = PipeOpFilter$new(filter = FilterVariance$new()) union = PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(2) svm = PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.svm&quot;, param_vals = list(kernel = &quot;linear&quot;))) # Assemble the Pipeline pipeline = copy %&gt;&gt;% gunion(list(pca, selection)) %&gt;&gt;% union %&gt;&gt;% svm learner = GraphLearner$new(id = &quot;Pipeline&quot;, pipeline) # For tuning, we define the resampling and the Parameter Space resampling = mlr3::mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;cv&quot;, param_vals = list(folds = 5L)) param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new(params = list( paradox::ParamDbl$new(&quot;classif.svm.cost&quot;, lower = 0.1, upper = 1), paradox::ParamInt$new(&quot;pca.rank.&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 3), paradox::ParamInt$new(&quot;variance.filter.nfeat&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 2) )) pe = PerformanceEvaluator$new(iris, learner, resampling, param_set) terminator = TerminatorEvaluations$new(60) tuner = TunerGridSearch$new(pe, terminator, resolution = 10)$tune() # Set the learner to the optimal values and train learner$param_set$values = tuner$tune_result()$values In summary, we can achieve similar results with a comparable number of lines, while at the same time offering greater flexibility with respect to which kinds of pipelines we want to optimize over. At the same time, experiments using mlr3 can now be arbitrarily parallelized using futures. 9.5.4 mlr3pipelines vs recipes recipes is a new package, that covers some of the same applications steps as mlr3pipelines. Both packages feature the possibility to connect different pre- and post-processing methods using a pipe-operator. As the recipes package tightly integrates with the tidymodels ecosystem, much of the functionality integrated there can be used in recipes. We compare recipes to mlr3pipelines using an example from the recipes vignette. The aim of the analysis is to predict whether customers pay back their loans given some information on the customers. In order to do this, we build a model that does the following: It first imputes missing values using k-nearest neighbors All factor variables are converted to numerics using dummy encoding The data is first centered then scaled. In order to validate the algorithm, data is first split into a train and test set using initial_split, training, testing. The recipe trained on the train data (see steps above) is then applied to the test data. 9.5.4.1 recipes library(&quot;tidymodels&quot;) library(&quot;rsample&quot;) data(&quot;credit_data&quot;, package = &quot;modeldata&quot;) set.seed(55) train_test_split = initial_split(credit_data) credit_train = training(train_test_split) credit_test = testing(train_test_split) rec = recipe(Status ~ ., data = credit_train) %&gt;% step_knnimpute(all_predictors()) %&gt;% step_dummy(all_predictors(), -all_numeric()) %&gt;% step_center(all_numeric()) %&gt;% step_scale(all_numeric()) trained_rec = prep(rec, training = credit_train) # Apply to train and test set train_data &lt;- bake(trained_rec, new_data = credit_train) test_data &lt;- bake(trained_rec, new_data = credit_test) Afterwards, the transformed data can be used during train and predict: # Train rf = rand_forest(mtry = 12, trees = 200, mode = &quot;classification&quot;) %&gt;% set_engine(&quot;ranger&quot;, importance = &#39;impurity&#39;) %&gt;% fit(Status ~ ., data = train_data) # Predict prds = predict(rf, test_data) 9.5.4.2 mlr3pipelines The same analysis can be performed in mlr3pipelines. Note, that for now we do not impute via knn but instead via sampling. library(&quot;data.table&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) library(&quot;mlr3pipelines&quot;) data(&quot;credit_data&quot;, package = &quot;modeldata&quot;) set.seed(55) # Create the task tsk = TaskClassif$new(id = &quot;credit_task&quot;, target = &quot;Status&quot;, backend = as_data_backend(data.table(credit_data))) # Build up the Pipeline: g = PipeOpImputeSample$new(id = &quot;impute&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpEncode$new(param_vals = list(method = &quot;one-hot&quot;)) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpScale$new() %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.ranger&quot;, param_vals = list(num.trees = 200, mtry = 12)) # We can visualize what happens to the data using the `plot` function: g$plot() # And we can use `mlr3&#39;s` full functionality be wrapping the Graph into a GraphLearner. glrn = GraphLearner$new(g) resample(tsk, glrn, mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;)) "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
